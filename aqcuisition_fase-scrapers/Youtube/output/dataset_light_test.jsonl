He described the woman who was shot dead in her car as “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and said she “violently, wilfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defence”.\n\nThe US Department for Homeland Security described the driver as a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.   It stated:  “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”\n\nJacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis held a press conference in which he told the ICE immigration officers to leave the city.  He said the Department for Homeland Security was:   “trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”   He accused the ICE agents of terrorising citizens, saying:   “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.”\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Nada Tawfik.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews", "channel_title": "BBC News", "published_at": "2026-01-07T23:41:51Z", "views": 508991, "likes": 3894, "comment_count": 6433, "duration_seconds": 226, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice", "immigration"], "should_hits": ["raid", "enforcement", "shooting", "officer"], "score": 8}, "_iteration": 1, "_archived_at": "2026-01-26T11:36:36.480704"}

Internal memos from earlier this year say they’re relying on so-called “administrative warrants.” These are not signed by a judge. Instead it’s literally the federal government giving itself permission to kick in your door. \n\nThis isn’t theoretical either. On at least one recent occasion reporters say they saw ICE use this on someone. Legal experts say this is a MAJOR violation of the Fourth Amendment’s “no unreasonable searches” clause. It also goes against YEARS of legal advice from immigration lawyers to not open your doors to law enforcement WITHOUT a judge-signed warrant.\n\nFor many others there’s a real fear that the bar for the government to break into your home is going to be drastically lowered. Homeland Security is pushing back and saying: 1. These people already had due process And 2. There’s already a final removal order for them to get removed. But here’s the problem: The Supreme Court has never actually ruled that admin warrants are valid for this.\n\nThe closest case was back in 1960, and the Court sidestepped actually making a ruling.\nMore recent rulings suggest they probably wouldn’t hold up, especially without an unbiased judge involved. And that matters, because a warrant is supposed to come from a neutral third party, not the same agency doing the raid. Even ICE’s own training materials used to admit admin warrants were legally questionable. But over the past year it’s reportedly told new hires to ignore that and instead follow this new memo.\n\n\nAll of which means we’re guaranteed to see legal fights over how admin warrants are allegedly being used right now.\n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: James Girardier, Maxwell Enright, Julie Goldberg, Christian Meeks, Matthew Henry\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research: Brian Espinoza, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#ICE #Minnesota #ICEWarrant", "channel_title": "DeFranco News Clips", "published_at": "2026-01-22T20:30:07Z", "views": 617896, "likes": 36065, "comment_count": 2313, "duration_seconds": 67, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice", "immigration"], "should_hits": ["raid", "enforcement"], "score": 6}, "_iteration": 1, "_archived_at": "2026-01-26T11:36:36.480704"}

Tim Walz said. The details surrounding the shooting weren’t immediately clear.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told the AP in a text messages that the person had a firearm with two magazines and that the situation was “evolving.”\n\nThe shooting happened amid widespread daily protests in the Twin Cities since the Jan. 7 shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fired into her vehicle. Saturday’s shooting unfolded just over a mile away from where Good was shot.\n\nWalz, a Democrat, said in a social media post that he had been in contact with the White House after the shooting. He urged President Donald Trump to end what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now,” Walz said in a post on X.\n\nDHS distributed a photo of a handgun they said was on the person who was shot.\n\nAfter the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car.\n\n\nThe intersection where the shooting has been blocked off, and Border Patrol agents are on the scene wielding batons.\n\nThe shooting happened a day after thousands of demonstrators protesting the crackdown on immigrants crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.\n_______________\nStay up to date with our social media:\n\nWWMT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wwmtnews\nWWMT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wwmtnews\nSubscribe to WWMT on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAYwomlsmN0DsPeeumEKFXg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWWMT Daily News Digest:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-oNVYSgKM8IBYJOY5M-p37vKcILekLNz\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.wwmt.com/\n\nHave a news tip?
