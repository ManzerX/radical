Annnnnd yeah this is a very strange way to deal UTH, never have seen the dealer get their cards last. I’m not smart enough to calculate their advantage to dealing that way, but it is certainly not normal. Not to mention them rearranging the board after each hand.  Looks like there’s a red light progressive you could be playing and that is typically tied to the flop, so moving the board would be confusing for surveillance, to say the least.  And lastly, I think you need to play the trips to have any shot on this carnival game.",
