  "title": "How broken are premium plants in PvZ2 speedruns?",
  "description": "Today we're speedrunning every world in Plants vs Zombies 2 but I can use whatever premium plants I want. Not great for my wallet but is great for going fast\n\nCheck out the world record for PvZ2 (not one with premium plants though since those don't exist lmao): https://youtu.be/6iNtnJ12srw\nCheck out @PerpetualPrince11's video with using max level plants: https://youtu.be/1Zlmb19WLxU\n\nCheck out the new merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\n\nEdited by: @TheSuitedBird \n\nBy the way, since this isn't an official speedrun and more of a challenge video to see how fast we could go, I did it segmented. That basically means I took breaks between some of the worlds and paused the timer during those breaks, because doing this speedrun on a phone really starts hurting my hands after a while. So it total, this run was over 3 days\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #PlantsVsZombies2 #Speedrun",
