  "description": "Protesters confronted ICE agents and Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino at a Minneapolis gas station on January 21 during Trump's massive immigration enforcement raids, shouting insults and blowing whistles as officers refueled amid chants accusing them of crimes. Bovino boasted arrests were \"fantastic\" despite the chaos, insisting operations continue undeterred while Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey slam the heavily armed federal sweeps as reckless and political. \n\n#minneapolis #ice #iceraids #trump #trumpimmigration #reneegood \n\nOC SLUGS\n\nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube",
