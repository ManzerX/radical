It’s quite unfortunate that they have been put into this position by the previous administration's blatant, outright dangerous, and careless polices that allowed 18 million or more unvetted and unchecked individuals to cross into the country illegally. Unfortunately, these individuals will not be able to acquire or seek due process as their removal needs to be swift and timely. . This has become a dire matter of national security. And also may I remind you of the events of September 11, 2001, as to why the need for secure borders in this country is paramount and essential . .",
