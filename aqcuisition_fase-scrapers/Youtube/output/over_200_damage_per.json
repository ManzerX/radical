  "description": "Break down of the build:\n\nHalf elf\nFighter 3, champion subclass\nPaladin 2\nWarlock 5, hexblade subclass, grab pact of the blade and thirsting blade\n\nNow with charisma as your attack stat you can use elven accuracy for your feat. If you have advantage (find familiar and help action for exemple), that’s 27% chance to crit.\n\nNow when you smite you can use warlock spell slots, dealing 4d8 for each, if you have a greatsword, that’s another 2d8, and Hex for another 1d6.\n\nTotal damage on this monster:\n((2d6 + 4d8 + 1d6)*2)+5, if you have max charisma, but you have two attacks, so you multiply that number by 2.\n\nAs you can see, you get some ridiculous damage, which recharged on a short rest, and on top of that you are super tanky due to Paladin and fighter levels.\n\nMy apologies to all DMs in advance, but seriously don’t use this build unless it’s a one shot session. It’s super hard to balance around for the other party members.\n\nFind all my free content here: https://www.monkeydm.com\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/m0nkeydm/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXP to level 3 with Davvychappy, potentially a bit a Critical Role with dungeoneering, tabletop community next to tabletop RPG, dungeons and dragons, Fjord, Beau, Jester, Yasha, Caleb, Nott, 5th edition dragons, 3.5e, dungeon dudes, DM GM, dungeon master, game master tips sprinkle a bit of Caduceus, Mollymauk in the Mighty Nein.

Her player isn't, but the character is def mad at me over a whole lot of singed fur. So, easiest way to do 200 damage in one round? Play a dumbass gunslinger. Who those who care, we use silver standard for money, and that explosion essentially cost me 30 gold",

Like weak skeletons linked to something not readily apparent or that is hidden some distance away. Make strong enemies spawn a 1 HP enemy in a random unoccupied space within 30 ft of him every round. It sounds harsh but what they will notice is they have to rest a lot more often. It should NOT be easy to even short rest in a hostile area, that's on the DM though. What this accomplishes is that combats take their toll once again and aren't trivial any longer.\n\nAlso you could just introduce a multiple health bar system. If the enemy is supposed to be strong, fighting alone or is a story-line enemy then just give it 3 health bars and have it revive as an undead version of itself with full HP and undead traits the first time it dies and then have it resurrect as a spirit version of itself with full HP and incorporeal traits the second time it dies. Slightly alter its attacks for each stage but don't change it's stats unless the new creature type requires that you do so.\n\nYou could also have even the normal strength lackeys and other such enemies burst in a 5ft radius emanation dealing like 2d6 damage and spawn something completely different, like an aberrant Horror of some kind with full HP and aberrant traits.\n\nUse any of these kinds of strategies and high damage characters will get to rejoice in their damage and combats won't feel as anti-climactic.",

I am going to assume you meant 2d6 greatsword and not shadow blade.\nThe build also doesn't have means to get advantage off by itself, so elven accuracy is currently pretty unreliable.\nIf I can make a suggestion, go for shadow blade instead of hex. It rewards you with 3d8 instead of 3d6, and only costs you 2d8 in smite damage over the turn. Shadow blade would also give yourself advantage in dim light, which is common in dungeons etc.\nThat makes the calculation from (3d6+4d8)*2+(3d6+2d8) *2 (average 96 without ability mods)\nto 3d8+4d8+(3d8+2d8)*3 (average 99 without ability mods)\nSo going with shadow blade actually delivers us more damage as well as a build in mechanic to give advantage. Still, the only way this character would hit 200 damage is if all 4 shots crit, or if the damage rolls were exceptional. But the chance of critting 4 times, even with this method would only be 1/250.",

Truly evil god forbid if the dm did this to their players. Since Psychic lance can be used in any scenario even if there is heavy obscurement so long as you know the target's names and as the villain you probably would depending on the story.

      "text": "If you crit with this build with a +5 mod to damage, you'll do an average of 127 damage with that attack.  This spends 2 slots (smite + hex), meaning if you did this multiple times with the same hex, you could do it a maximum of 3 times in one combat.  Later on, either you give up on hex or can only do it once, as you'll run out of paladin slots.  Not to mention this doesn't factor it the 73% of the time where you either don't crit or miss entirely and also the fact that this build doesn't integrate a reliable way to give itself advantage on attacks in the first place, so a lot of the time your 27% crit chance would probably just be 10% from champion.  Overall, this build runs through resources too quickly, can't nova well because you can't decide when to crit, and likely would have very low DPR if you were to actually calculate it.  Saying that it has over 200 damage per turn is pretty misleading, as that statement makes you think that it can do it every turn, which it most definitely cannot.  Honestly anyone who believes that a critfishing build is powerful doesn't know what they're talking about.",
