The footage captures ICE agents arresting immigrants during what authorities describe as lawful immigration arrests, with some individuals appearing to resist arrest as officers moved in. The video has spread rapidly online, fueling debate over ICE raids, ICE arrests, and illegal immigration in New York City.\n\nThe arrests come amid heightened tensions in New York, where anti-ICE protesters recently disrupted a Home Depot store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, protesting ICE immigration raids and federal enforcement efforts. These incidents are unfolding as ICE operations expand nationwide, with ICE agents arresting illegal immigrants in major cities as part of a broader ICE deportation and enforcement crackdown. Under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have signaled a renewed push in 2025 to combat illegal immigration, ramp up ICE arresting immigrants, and restore law-and-order immigration policies across the country.\n\n👍🏿CashApp\nhttps://cash.app/$TDMediaGroup\n👍🏿Venmo\n@TDMediaGroup\n👍🏿PayPal\npaypal.me/TDMediaGroup", "channel_title": "TD Media Group Clips", "published_at": "2025-12-23T16:27:18Z", "views": 32539, "likes": 1318, "comment_count": 405, "duration_seconds": 615, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "raids", "deportation", "enforcement", "arrest", "officer", "immigration", "officer"], "score": 10}}

Internal memos from earlier this year say they’re relying on so-called “administrative warrants.” These are not signed by a judge. Instead it’s literally the federal government giving itself permission to kick in your door. \n\nThis isn’t theoretical either. On at least one recent occasion reporters say they saw ICE use this on someone. Legal experts say this is a MAJOR violation of the Fourth Amendment’s “no unreasonable searches” clause. It also goes against YEARS of legal advice from immigration lawyers to not open your doors to law enforcement WITHOUT a judge-signed warrant.\n\nFor many others there’s a real fear that the bar for the government to break into your home is going to be drastically lowered. Homeland Security is pushing back and saying: 1. These people already had due process And 2. There’s already a final removal order for them to get removed. But here’s the problem: The Supreme Court has never actually ruled that admin warrants are valid for this.\n\nThe closest case was back in 1960, and the Court sidestepped actually making a ruling.\nMore recent rulings suggest they probably wouldn’t hold up, especially without an unbiased judge involved. And that matters, because a warrant is supposed to come from a neutral third party, not the same agency doing the raid. Even ICE’s own training materials used to admit admin warrants were legally questionable. But over the past year it’s reportedly told new hires to ignore that and instead follow this new memo.\n\n\nAll of which means we’re guaranteed to see legal fights over how admin warrants are allegedly being used right now.\n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: James Girardier, Maxwell Enright, Julie Goldberg, Christian Meeks, Matthew Henry\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research: Brian Espinoza, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#ICE #Minnesota #ICEWarrant", "channel_title": "DeFranco News Clips", "published_at": "2026-01-22T20:30:07Z", "views": 618424, "likes": 36104, "comment_count": 2315, "duration_seconds": 67, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "enforcement", "immigration"], "score": 5}}

Entry-level officers typically begin at GS-5 or GS-7, earning between $40,000 to $50,000 per year. Within just a few years, many reach GS-12, where base salaries rise to over $80,000, not including overtime, premium pay, or locality adjustments. In high-cost areas like California or New York, total compensation can exceed $130,000 per year. CBP officers also receive federal benefits, paid training, and opportunities for promotion to GS-13 and above. If you're considering a career in law enforcement or homeland security, CBP offers one of the most financially rewarding federal jobs—especially with growth potential.

SOUNDBITE (English) Elliot Spagat, The Associated Press:\r\n++SOUNDBITE PARTIALLY COVERED++\r\n\"Greg Bovino has cut from a different cloth when it comes to U.S. Immigration authorities. He relishes the spotlight. He has a very active presence on social media. You see him wearing M4 assault rifles and full tactical gear, rap music playing in the background. He gets in public spats with officials who oppose the Trump administration's agenda. In a very short time, he's become a public face of the administration's efforts at mass deportation. We saw him first in Los Angeles, where he assumed the title of Border Patrol Commander-at-Large. From there, he went to Chicago. He went to Charlotte, North Carolina, New Orleans, most recently in Minneapolis. He's been in just about all of the major confrontational scenes that we've witnessed, maybe not all, but a significant percentage. He has been there on camera and enjoying it. In Chicago, just one example, a helicopter landed on the roof of an apartment building, agents repelling down the side of it. He was there, he was on Chicago's Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River. He's in the spotlight, in your face, and he makes no bones about it that the Border Patrol, he’s taken the Border Patrol's more aggressive tactics that we see on the border and making them much more common, and almost replacing ICE's more methodical, targeted approach, he calls it turn and burn. It's a system to get in quickly, make the arrest, rack them up, and get out before the protesters arrive.”\r\n\r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nARCHIVE: Charlotte, North Carolina - 17 November 2025\r\n3.

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who protested President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his city. \n\nA massive winter storm set the stage for a brutal travel day Sunday, with airlines warning of widespread cancellations and delays at some of the nation’s busiest airports. Widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain threatened nearly 180 million people — more than half the U.S. population — in a path stretching from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England, the National Weather Service said Saturday night. After sweeping through the South, forecasters said the storm was expected to move into the Northeast, dumping about 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston.\n\n\nSubscribe to LiveNOW from FOX! https://www.youtube.com/livenowfox?sub_confirmation=1\nWhere to watch LiveNOW from FOX: https://www.livenowfox.com\nFollow us @LiveNOWFOX on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livenowfox\n\nRaw and unfiltered.

And that is the fallout from just one of many protests happening in the state today.\n\nThe clergy members were at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport to take a stand against airlines running deportation flights. Footage showing them singing outside, praying, braving subzero temperatures to call for these flights to stop.\n\nBut they were reportedly arrested and ziptied for ignoring commands from airport and local police to clear the road. With airport officials also claiming the protest exceeded the permitted number of people.\n\nAnd today, there are tons of other major marches, rallies, and boycotts happening calling for ICE to get out of Minnesota. With residents encouraged to not go to school, work, or shop, and many businesses have shuttered their doors to stand in solidarity with immigrants. And while DHS has slammed this protest and economic blackout, claiming it hurts law-abiding Americans, the protestors say they are participating to protect their neighbors and call for justice. \n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: James Girardier, Maxwell Enright, Julie Goldberg, Christian Meeks, Matthew Henry\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research:  Maddie Crichton, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#America #USA #ICE", "channel_title": "DeFranco News Clips", "published_at": "2026-01-23T22:31:59Z", "views": 563764, "likes": 37350, "comment_count": 1487, "duration_seconds": 44, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["deportation", "arrest"], "score": 4}}

Critics warn this will unleash more raids, disrupt the economy and severely restrict access to humanitarian protections.\n\nA new detention facility dubbed ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ has also been created in southern Florida while reports emerge of a succession of alleged abuses at Ice operated jails in the state since January - including detainees at one Miami immigration jail being made to kneel to eat food from Styrofoam plates ‘like dogs’, according to a report released on Monday.\n\nBut even before detained people reach jail, Ice’s increasingly aggressive and secretive actions have made them face accusations of being ‘ominous and clouded in mystery, and clearly weapons for the Trump regime to violate rights and literally disappear people’, according to Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\n\nWhile there are efforts to curb Ice, including the introduction of a bill by Democratic senators to prohibit agents from wearing masks and 12 immigrants suing the Trump administration for arresting people at immigration courts, critics say there is reason to be concerned about the agency’s growing impunity.\n\n‘When it runs out of brown and Black people to deport, Ice - perhaps under another name - will be left with the authority and capability to surveil, seize and disappear anyone the administration considers undesirable,’ writes Brooklyn journalist Judith Levine.\n\nBut how can Ice get away with these measures?\n\nWatch as the Guardian’s US live news editor Chris Michael explains how they’re about to become the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the US – and to read in depth about what this means for the country, tap the link ► https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\n\n#ice #iceraids #icearrests #trump #donaldtrump #politics #shorts #usa #massdeportations #undocumentedimmigrants #migrants #refugees #uscitizens #immigration", "channel_title": "The Guardian", "published_at": "2025-07-23T13:00:07Z", "views": 96887, "likes": 7321, "comment_count": 592, "duration_seconds": 178, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "raids", "deportation", "deportations", "enforcement", "arrest", "detention", "border", "immigration"], "score": 11}}

I'm told the person is \"down\" and medics are working on them. No details yet on who it was or what led up to the shooting. Working sources and will update when I have more,\" Fox News reporter Bill Melugin wrote on X.\n\nCitizen journalist Collin Rugg posted footage that appears to show the final moments before the suspect was shot. It appears he was in a struggle with multiple federal agents. About 20 seconds into the video, an apparent gunshot is heard, with the suspect lying on the ground.\n\nDHS has issued a statement regarding the incident: \n\nAt 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault, an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here. \n\nThe officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted. More details on the armed struggle are forthcoming. \n\nFearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\nThe suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement. \n\nAbout 200 rioters arrived at the scene and began to obstruct and assault law enforcement on the scene, crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement. \n\nAs noted by DHS, protesters have come out in force, resulting in the deployment of tear gas.\n\n\nLearn More:\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/border-patrol-agent-shoots-armed-suspect-minneapolis\n\nYour Support of Independent Media Is Appreciated.\n\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/DAHBOO7\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/dahboo7\n\nSocials-\n\nDLive- https://dlive.tv/DAHBOO7\n\nRumble- https://rumble.com/c/DAHBOO7\n\nInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/dahboo7\n\nSurviving End Times -  https://www.youtube.com/Dahboo777\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dahboo7\n\nUWN Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/DAHBOO7/", "channel_title": "DAHBOO77", "published_at": "2026-01-24T19:00:01Z", "views": 21776, "likes": 2082, "comment_count": 712, "duration_seconds": 219, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["enforcement", "border", "shooting", "officer", "immigration", "officer"], "score": 8}}

Tim Walz said. The details surrounding the shooting weren’t immediately clear.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told the AP in a text messages that the person had a firearm with two magazines and that the situation was “evolving.”\n\nThe shooting happened amid widespread daily protests in the Twin Cities since the Jan. 7 shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fired into her vehicle. Saturday’s shooting unfolded just over a mile away from where Good was shot.\n\nWalz, a Democrat, said in a social media post that he had been in contact with the White House after the shooting. He urged President Donald Trump to end what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now,” Walz said in a post on X.\n\nDHS distributed a photo of a handgun they said was on the person who was shot.\n\nAfter the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car.\n\n\nThe intersection where the shooting has been blocked off, and Border Patrol agents are on the scene wielding batons.\n\nThe shooting happened a day after thousands of demonstrators protesting the crackdown on immigrants crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.\n_______________\nStay up to date with our social media:\n\nWWMT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wwmtnews\nWWMT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wwmtnews\nSubscribe to WWMT on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAYwomlsmN0DsPeeumEKFXg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWWMT Daily News Digest:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-oNVYSgKM8IBYJOY5M-p37vKcILekLNz\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.wwmt.com/\n\nHave a news tip?

Cette montée en force de l’ICE a été marquée début janvier 2026 par la mort de Renee Nicole Good, une citoyenne américaine de 37 ans, tuée par un agent à Minneapolis. Cet événement a déclenché des manifestations et une vive émotion à l’échelle nationale, et relance les critiques contre les méthodes de l’agence, qui affirme avoir procédé à plus de 605 000 expulsions depuis janvier 2025.\n\nPour ne rien manquer, abonnez-vous à notre infolettre : https://radio-canada.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ba24954b695f1375d65bc7e67&id=96746db0ea\n\nEt à nos autres plateformes :\nTikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@radpointca\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/radpointca/\n\n__\nRetrouvez tous nos contenus sur notre site : https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/rad\n\nRad, c’est le laboratoire de journalisme de Radio-Canada.

Every year, drug cartels and human smugglers operate with impunity, trafficking billions of dollars in narcotics and thousands of people into the United States. This documentary provides unique access to the elite police units on the front lines of this battle.\n\nWe follow the Maricopa County Sheriff's human smuggling unit (HSU) as they raid \"drophouses\" in Phoenix, properties where illegal immigrants are held in brutal conditions. We also go on a high-speed chase with the Nogales Police Department, seizing a massive haul of marijuana and a dangerous cache of weapons from drug runners. Finally, we witness a major FBI and SWAT operation to take down violent street gangs responsible for trafficking narcotics across the country.\n\nThis is a look at the relentless and often brutal fight to secure America's borders, where law enforcement battles a constantly evolving criminal underworld in an endless cycle of crime and enforcement.\n\nBorder Invasion Series 01 Episode 03\n\nWant to watch more docudramas? \nClick here: https://bit.ly/3ivnDhE\n\n#truestories #retold", "channel_title": "Documentary Vault", "published_at": "2025-08-30T20:00:11Z", "views": 31168, "likes": 194, "comment_count": 11, "duration_seconds": 2568, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "enforcement", "border"], "score": 5}}

Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.\n\nNow, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.\n\nTYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts.

He described the woman who was shot dead in her car as “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and said she “violently, wilfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defence”.\n\nThe US Department for Homeland Security described the driver as a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.   It stated:  “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”\n\nJacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis held a press conference in which he told the ICE immigration officers to leave the city.  He said the Department for Homeland Security was:   “trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”   He accused the ICE agents of terrorising citizens, saying:   “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.”\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Nada Tawfik.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews", "channel_title": "BBC News", "published_at": "2026-01-07T23:41:51Z", "views": 509033, "likes": 3894, "comment_count": 6433, "duration_seconds": 226, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "enforcement", "shooting", "officer", "immigration", "officer"], "score": 8}}

Calls are now growing for an independent investigation as videos remain under review.\r\n\r\n#MinneapolisShooting #FederalShooting #AlexPretti #BreakingNews #PoliceShooting #DHSInvestigation #OfficerInvolvedShooting #BodyCamVideo #CNNAnalysis #IndependentInvestigation #UseOfForce #LawfulGunOwner #MinneapolisNews #FederalAgents #JusticeForPretti #PoliceAccountability\n#oneindianews #oneindiaenglish #breakingnews #worldnews #englishnewslive #englishnews #latestnews #news\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

This surge — one of the largest in recent U.S. history — includes officers from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations, with the mission scheduled to run about 30 days and target both immigration violations and alleged fraud. Officials say the operation builds on a broader DHS effort in Minnesota that has ramped up arrests of immigrants with deportation orders while federal investigators pursue major fraud cases tied to misuse of taxpayer funds. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and senior federal leaders are directly involved, emphasizing interior enforcement after years of lax policy, even as the increased presence has sparked local tensions and protests. This deployment underscores the administration’s commitment to tightening border security and interior immigration law enforcement amid concerns over fraud, public safety, and immigrant accountability.\n\nIn 2026, ICE operations have expanded nationwide, with ICE agents increasing the number of immigration arrests, targeted ICE raids, and interior enforcement actions focused on illegal immigrants with criminal records or prior deportation orders. These ICE agents are working alongside federal teams to conduct ICE immigration raids, resulting in illegal immigrants arrested in multiple states as part of the crackdown. Officials stress that the goal is not simply ICE deportation, but also dismantling fraud networks and holding those who violate immigration law accountable. During these enforcement actions, some migrants have been reported resisting arrest, while others have complied as ICE police and federal task forces continue arresting individuals tied to immigration violations and fraud activity. The administration says the rise in ICE arrests and ICE agents arresting immigrants reflects a renewed focus on border security, national security, and the rule of law in response to the ongoing illegal immigration crisis.\n\n🤝🏿✊🏿https://www.patreon.com/tdmediagroup\n***For those who recognize the value of TD Media Group as well as the importance of it growing independent of YouTube.

That that is the story that is most poignant here,” he added.\n \nOn Saturday, Bovino stated Pretti was armed and “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” However, federal agents are facing mass scrutiny from politicians and the general public after videos showing several angles of the altercation show no clear evidence Pretti brandished a weapon before being killed.\n \n“You’ve had 24 hours to try and armchair-quarterback things, that agent had a split second to make a decision,” Bovino told reporters when asked whether agents actually saw that Pretti was armed.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/11636403/minnesota-shooting-ice/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on TikTok HERE: https://www.tiktok.com/@globalnews.ca?lang=en \n#GlobalNews #ICE #Minnesota", "channel_title": "Global News", "published_at": "2026-01-25T19:25:28Z", "views": 95293, "likes": 170, "comment_count": 706, "duration_seconds": 1071, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["enforcement", "border", "shooting"], "score": 5}}

Morris was arrested on a bench warrant for failing to appear at a previous court hearing. A drug test earlier in the day also revealed he was high during his arrest. In this video, we see Juvenile Intake Officer, Liz, field a call from Morris's mom after Morris has been booked into juvie, then watch as Morris and his mother have a frank conversation now that he's landed back in detention for the second time. During the call, Liz explains the visitation process and goes over what Morris's mom needs to know before his court hearing in a few days.  \n\nOnce the intake process is complete, it's time for Morris to be escorted to the detention center cell pods, where he will join dozens of other kids who are also detained and waiting for their day in court.  It's not unusual for kids who wind up in detention to ask our camera crew and producers what they can expect once they're processed into the cell pods.

But across the country U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is targeting 11 million undocumented migrants, and tasked to make 3,000 arrests a day.\n \nOn the ground Chatterjee joins lawyer Bryan Sanchez investigating a raid in San Bernardino where unidentifiable masked men have rammed another vehicle and arresting its driver.\n \nBut across Los Angeles, families are living with the consequences of these arrests. Chatterjee meets families like Fatima and Fernando, whose father Felix was seized at a Home Depot where he works after 35 years living in the US.\n \nThe community is mobilising to frustrate the arrests. In downtown Los Angeles, activists led by teacher Ron Gochez patrol neighbourhoods, using radios and apps to track ICE movements. But the crackdown is dividing opinion, and some Latino Trump supporters say the deportations are necessary to uphold the law.\n \nFilmed and Directed by: Nick Blakemore\nPicture Editor: Claire Pringle\nSeries Producer: Andy Lee\nExecutive Producer: Ed Fraser\nProduction Company: Channel 4 News\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more Unreported World episodes https://www.youtube.com/unreportedworld.", "channel_title": "Unreported World", "published_at": "2025-11-09T17:30:06Z", "views": 52178, "likes": 978, "comment_count": 756, "duration_seconds": 1417, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "raids", "deportation", "deportations", "enforcement", "arrest", "immigration"], "score": 9}}
