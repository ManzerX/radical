There are actions and consequences that come with those choices.”\n\nTelling Americans they CAN’T say something is definitely a choice. Even right-wing figures joined in and called him the Gestapo. It doesn’t help that Bovino loves to wear a huge overcoat that instantly reminds everyone of Nazi uniforms. Officials said that he’s done so since 1999 and it’s part of CBP’s winter uniform. If that’s true it’s news to everyone, because Border Patrol’s own standards don’t list a greatcoat as a uniform option. \n\nICE’s own actions aren’t helping them beat the Gestapo allegations. They go around asking Americans for their papers to prove their citizens, Something that’s never been required before. Running into them to do so means you could be sent to some prison abroad . All of which happens EXTREMELY fast and with little time to get legal intervention. And their identities are secret and they seem to have near immunity to repercussions. All of which makes them a de facto secret police.

And that is the fallout from just one of many protests happening in the state today.\n\nThe clergy members were at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport to take a stand against airlines running deportation flights. Footage showing them singing outside, praying, braving subzero temperatures to call for these flights to stop.\n\nBut they were reportedly arrested and ziptied for ignoring commands from airport and local police to clear the road. With airport officials also claiming the protest exceeded the permitted number of people.\n\nAnd today, there are tons of other major marches, rallies, and boycotts happening calling for ICE to get out of Minnesota. With residents encouraged to not go to school, work, or shop, and many businesses have shuttered their doors to stand in solidarity with immigrants. And while DHS has slammed this protest and economic blackout, claiming it hurts law-abiding Americans, the protestors say they are participating to protect their neighbors and call for justice. \n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: James Girardier, Maxwell Enright, Julie Goldberg, Christian Meeks, Matthew Henry\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research:  Maddie Crichton, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#America #USA #ICE", "channel_title": "DeFranco News Clips", "published_at": "2026-01-23T22:31:59Z", "views": 610584, "likes": 39163, "comment_count": 1555, "duration_seconds": 44, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["deportation", "dhs", "usa", "america", "americans", "immigrant", "immigrants", "arrest", "arrested", "protest", "protests", "protestors", "anti-ice"], "score": 15}}

Internal memos from earlier this year say they’re relying on so-called “administrative warrants.” These are not signed by a judge. Instead it’s literally the federal government giving itself permission to kick in your door. \n\nThis isn’t theoretical either. On at least one recent occasion reporters say they saw ICE use this on someone. Legal experts say this is a MAJOR violation of the Fourth Amendment’s “no unreasonable searches” clause. It also goes against YEARS of legal advice from immigration lawyers to not open your doors to law enforcement WITHOUT a judge-signed warrant.\n\nFor many others there’s a real fear that the bar for the government to break into your home is going to be drastically lowered. Homeland Security is pushing back and saying: 1. These people already had due process And 2. There’s already a final removal order for them to get removed. But here’s the problem: The Supreme Court has never actually ruled that admin warrants are valid for this.\n\nThe closest case was back in 1960, and the Court sidestepped actually making a ruling.\nMore recent rulings suggest they probably wouldn’t hold up, especially without an unbiased judge involved. And that matters, because a warrant is supposed to come from a neutral third party, not the same agency doing the raid. Even ICE’s own training materials used to admit admin warrants were legally questionable. But over the past year it’s reportedly told new hires to ignore that and instead follow this new memo.\n\n\nAll of which means we’re guaranteed to see legal fights over how admin warrants are allegedly being used right now.\n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: James Girardier, Maxwell Enright, Julie Goldberg, Christian Meeks, Matthew Henry\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research: Brian Espinoza, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#ICE #Minnesota #ICEWarrant", "channel_title": "DeFranco News Clips", "published_at": "2026-01-22T20:30:07Z", "views": 651764, "likes": 37578, "comment_count": 2391, "duration_seconds": 67, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "admin", "homeland security", "immigration", "government"], "score": 7}}

Morris was arrested on a bench warrant for failing to appear at a previous court hearing. A drug test earlier in the day also revealed he was high during his arrest. In this video, we see Juvenile Intake Officer, Liz, field a call from Morris's mom after Morris has been booked into juvie, then watch as Morris and his mother have a frank conversation now that he's landed back in detention for the second time. During the call, Liz explains the visitation process and goes over what Morris's mom needs to know before his court hearing in a few days.  \n\nOnce the intake process is complete, it's time for Morris to be escorted to the detention center cell pods, where he will join dozens of other kids who are also detained and waiting for their day in court.  It's not unusual for kids who wind up in detention to ask our camera crew and producers what they can expect once they're processed into the cell pods. This video shows the process from beginning to end -- from the pat down at intake to the kids playing cards in the cell pod to the showering-in process where everyone must wash their hair with a disinfectant to prevent lice.\n\nNote:  Following his court hearings, Morris was court ordered to a placement facility where he lived for a period of time and received counseling and services. He eventually ran away from the facility. A few years later, he served time in adult prison for robbery and was released. \n\nWatch Morris's 2-part documentary here:\nhttps://youtu.be/SswjgFqqHv8\nhttps://youtu.be/Zs3lj1KfSsI\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to catch new content coming out every week!\n\nAll content provided by:  Calamari Productions LLC\n\nCheck out more:\ncalamariproductions.com\nsocietyeducationmedia.com", "channel_title": "Calamari Productions", "published_at": "2021-06-06T17:22:00Z", "views": 1983633, "likes": 20022, "comment_count": 1194, "duration_seconds": 743, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["officer", "arrest", "arrested"], "score": 5}}

We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.\n\nThe Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYT Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We’re about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.\n\nOn the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.\n\nOur commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.\n\nNow, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.\n\nTYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We’ve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We’re thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.\n\nTYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.\n\nTYT’s 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.\n\nTYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.\n\nSUBSCRIBE on YOUTUBE: ☞ http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=theyoungturks\nFACEBOOK: ☞ http://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks\nTWITTER: ☞ http://www.twitter.com/TheYoungTurks\nINSTAGRAM: ☞ http://www.instagram.com/TheYoungTurks\nTWITCH: ☞ http://www.twitch.com/tyt\n\n👕 Merch: http://shoptyt.com\n\n❤ Donate: http://www.tyt.com/go\n\n🔗 Website: https://www.tyt.com\n\n\nIf you want to watch more videos from TYT, consider subscribing to other channels in our network:\n\nThe Watchlist https://www.youtube.com/watchlisttyt\n\nIndisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey https://www.youtube.com/indisputabletyt\n\nThe Damage Report ▶ https://www.youtube.com/thedamagereport\n\nTYT Sports ▶ https://www.youtube.com/tytsports\n\nThe Conversation ▶ https://www.youtube.com/tytconversation\n\nRebel HQ ▶ https://www.youtube.com/rebelhq\n\nTYT Investigates ▶ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwNJt9PYyN1uyw2XhNIQMMA\n\n\n#TYT #TheYoungTurks #BreakingNews\n\n\n260120__MS02RoganRNG_REPURP_V2", "channel_title": "The Young Turks", "published_at": "2026-01-24T22:00:00Z", "views": 683411, "likes": 18908, "comment_count": 9269, "duration_seconds": 924, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["agent", "agents", "america", "americans", "citizen", "citizens"], "score": 8}}

Critics warn this will unleash more raids, disrupt the economy and severely restrict access to humanitarian protections.\n\nA new detention facility dubbed ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ has also been created in southern Florida while reports emerge of a succession of alleged abuses at Ice operated jails in the state since January - including detainees at one Miami immigration jail being made to kneel to eat food from Styrofoam plates ‘like dogs’, according to a report released on Monday.\n\nBut even before detained people reach jail, Ice’s increasingly aggressive and secretive actions have made them face accusations of being ‘ominous and clouded in mystery, and clearly weapons for the Trump regime to violate rights and literally disappear people’, according to Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\n\nWhile there are efforts to curb Ice, including the introduction of a bill by Democratic senators to prohibit agents from wearing masks and 12 immigrants suing the Trump administration for arresting people at immigration courts, critics say there is reason to be concerned about the agency’s growing impunity.\n\n‘When it runs out of brown and Black people to deport, Ice - perhaps under another name - will be left with the authority and capability to surveil, seize and disappear anyone the administration considers undesirable,’ writes Brooklyn journalist Judith Levine.\n\nBut how can Ice get away with these measures?\n\nWatch as the Guardian’s US live news editor Chris Michael explains how they’re about to become the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the US – and to read in depth about what this means for the country, tap the link ► https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\n\n#ice #iceraids #icearrests #trump #donaldtrump #politics #shorts #usa #massdeportations #undocumentedimmigrants #migrants #refugees #uscitizens #immigration", "channel_title": "The Guardian", "published_at": "2025-07-23T13:00:07Z", "views": 108178, "likes": 8250, "comment_count": 624, "duration_seconds": 178, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["deportation", "deportations", "raid", "raids", "mask", "masks", "agent", "agents", "trump", "administration", "trump admin", "admin", "trump administration", "immigration and customs enforcement", "usa", "immigration", "immigrant", "immigrants", "president", "arrest", "arrests", "arresting", "border", "citizen", "citizens"], "score": 27}}

He described the woman who was shot dead in her car as “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and said she “violently, wilfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defence”.\n\nThe US Department for Homeland Security described the driver as a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.   It stated:  “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”\n\nJacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis held a press conference in which he told the ICE immigration officers to leave the city.  He said the Department for Homeland Security was:   “trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”   He accused the ICE agents of terrorising citizens, saying:   “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.”\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Nada Tawfik.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews", "channel_title": "BBC News", "published_at": "2026-01-07T23:41:51Z", "views": 510539, "likes": 3900, "comment_count": 6425, "duration_seconds": 226, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "shooting", "agent", "agents", "officer", "officers", "trump", "administration", "trump admin", "admin", "trump administration", "homeland security", "immigration", "president", "citizen", "citizens"], "score": 18}}

This surge — one of the largest in recent U.S. history — includes officers from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations, with the mission scheduled to run about 30 days and target both immigration violations and alleged fraud. Officials say the operation builds on a broader DHS effort in Minnesota that has ramped up arrests of immigrants with deportation orders while federal investigators pursue major fraud cases tied to misuse of taxpayer funds. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and senior federal leaders are directly involved, emphasizing interior enforcement after years of lax policy, even as the increased presence has sparked local tensions and protests. This deployment underscores the administration’s commitment to tightening border security and interior immigration law enforcement amid concerns over fraud, public safety, and immigrant accountability.\n\nIn 2026, ICE operations have expanded nationwide, with ICE agents increasing the number of immigration arrests, targeted ICE raids, and interior enforcement actions focused on illegal immigrants with criminal records or prior deportation orders. These ICE agents are working alongside federal teams to conduct ICE immigration raids, resulting in illegal immigrants arrested in multiple states as part of the crackdown. Officials stress that the goal is not simply ICE deportation, but also dismantling fraud networks and holding those who violate immigration law accountable. During these enforcement actions, some migrants have been reported resisting arrest, while others have complied as ICE police and federal task forces continue arresting individuals tied to immigration violations and fraud activity. The administration says the rise in ICE arrests and ICE agents arresting immigrants reflects a renewed focus on border security, national security, and the rule of law in response to the ongoing illegal immigration crisis.\n\n🤝🏿✊🏿https://www.patreon.com/tdmediagroup\n***For those who recognize the value of TD Media Group as well as the importance of it growing independent of YouTube.

Officials say the man was armed and resisted, but video circulating online shows a struggle before shots were fired. This is the second fatal shooting involving ICE/Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis this month, sparking protests and calls for accountability. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates, video, reactions, and eyewitness reports live RIGHT NOW. 🇺🇸\n #Minnesota #Minneapolis #ICENews #BreakingNews #LiveUpdates\n\nOver the past weeks, federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis and surrounding areas as part of a surge operation have faced large-scale protests and legal challenges. The unrest was fueled in early January after an ICE agent fatally shot a local woman, Renée Nicole Good, during an enforcement operation — a controversial incident that sparked widespread outrage and ongoing demonstrations across the state.\n\nIn response to reports of aggressive tactics — including the use of tear gas, arrests of observers, and confrontations with demonstrators — a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction restricting ICE agents from using force, detaining peaceful protesters, or retaliating against observers unless there was lawful suspicion of criminal activity. The order aimed to protect First Amendment rights and curb perceived excessive force.\n\nHowever, these restrictions were temporarily paused by a federal appeals court, which granted an administrative stay as the government appeals the ruling — allowing ICE more leeway in tactics while the case continues.\n\nAcross Minnesota, activists and community groups have escalated resistance — organizing statewide protest actions, including an economic blackout/general strike, urging people not to go to work, school, or shop to show solidarity with immigrant communities and oppose the federal enforcement presence. Businesses, museums, and unions have participated in these demonstrations.\n\nMeanwhile, federal authorities are continuing operations under what they describe as lawful immigration enforcement, and high-level officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have traveled to Minneapolis to defend ICE actions and call for cooperation with local leaders to ease tensions.\n\nToday’s developments also include arrests of civil rights activists linked to protests — including demonstrations inside a church in St. Paul — and continued national media attention on the debate over immigration enforcement tactics and civil liberties.\n\n🔔 Stay tuned as we continue streaming live with updates, protest footage, legal developments, community responses, and reactions from local and federal officials.\n\n#Minneapolis  #Ice #Protests #Oakland \n\n📌 How to Support, Watch & Engage:\n\n• If you’re near one of the affected cities, stay safe: consider legal-rights resources, know your surroundings, record encounters if safe to do so.\n• Share this livestream so more people can see what’s happening in real time and holding these operations in public view.\n• We’ll update the stream with latest developments, viewer-submitted clips, and rotate between locations.\n\n🔴 SUPPORT THE STREAM SUPER CHAT CASHAPP @DJB510 PAY PAL AND VENMO LINK 👉 https://streamlabs.com/djb5101 THANKS!\n\n\n⚠️[Disclaimer] This video is for educational, informational and news reporting purposes only.

The video has spread rapidly online, fueling debate over ICE raids, ICE arrests, and illegal immigration in New York City.\n\nThe arrests come amid heightened tensions in New York, where anti-ICE protesters recently disrupted a Home Depot store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, protesting ICE immigration raids and federal enforcement efforts. These incidents are unfolding as ICE operations expand nationwide, with ICE agents arresting illegal immigrants in major cities as part of a broader ICE deportation and enforcement crackdown. Under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have signaled a renewed push in 2025 to combat illegal immigration, ramp up ICE arresting immigrants, and restore law-and-order immigration policies across the country.\n\n👍🏿CashApp\nhttps://cash.app/$TDMediaGroup\n👍🏿Venmo\n@TDMediaGroup\n👍🏿PayPal\npaypal.me/TDMediaGroup", "channel_title": "TD Media Group Clips", "published_at": "2025-12-23T16:27:18Z", "views": 32575, "likes": 1318, "comment_count": 404, "duration_seconds": 615, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["deportation", "raid", "raids", "agent", "agents", "officer", "officers", "trump", "immigration", "immigrant", "immigrants", "president", "illegal", "arrest", "arrests", "arrested", "arresting", "protest", "protester", "anti-ice"], "score": 22}}

But across the country U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is targeting 11 million undocumented migrants, and tasked to make 3,000 arrests a day.\n \nOn the ground Chatterjee joins lawyer Bryan Sanchez investigating a raid in San Bernardino where unidentifiable masked men have rammed another vehicle and arresting its driver.\n \nBut across Los Angeles, families are living with the consequences of these arrests. Chatterjee meets families like Fatima and Fernando, whose father Felix was seized at a Home Depot where he works after 35 years living in the US.\n \nThe community is mobilising to frustrate the arrests. In downtown Los Angeles, activists led by teacher Ron Gochez patrol neighbourhoods, using radios and apps to track ICE movements. But the crackdown is dividing opinion, and some Latino Trump supporters say the deportations are necessary to uphold the law.\n \nFilmed and Directed by: Nick Blakemore\nPicture Editor: Claire Pringle\nSeries Producer: Andy Lee\nExecutive Producer: Ed Fraser\nProduction Company: Channel 4 News\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more Unreported World episodes https://www.youtube.com/unreportedworld.", "channel_title": "Unreported World", "published_at": "2025-11-09T17:30:06Z", "views": 52303, "likes": 979, "comment_count": 756, "duration_seconds": 1417, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["deportation", "deportations", "raid", "raids", "mask", "masked", "agent", "agents", "trump", "immigration and customs enforcement", "immigration", "president", "arrest", "arrests", "arresting"], "score": 17}}

Entry-level officers typically begin at GS-5 or GS-7, earning between $40,000 to $50,000 per year. Within just a few years, many reach GS-12, where base salaries rise to over $80,000, not including overtime, premium pay, or locality adjustments. In high-cost areas like California or New York, total compensation can exceed $130,000 per year. CBP officers also receive federal benefits, paid training, and opportunities for promotion to GS-13 and above. If you're considering a career in law enforcement or homeland security, CBP offers one of the most financially rewarding federal jobs—especially with growth potential. Learn how the pay structure works, and why your first year is just the beginning of something big.\n\n#CBPPayScale #FederalJobs #BorderPatrolSalary #LawEnforcementCareers #CBPBenefits #GS12Pay", "channel_title": "CBPO, LEO, FAMS, FBI and Secret Service hub", "published_at": "2025-04-25T00:20:52Z", "views": 18765, "likes": 324, "comment_count": 171, "duration_seconds": 700, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["agent", "agents", "officer", "officers", "homeland security", "border", "border patrol"], "score": 9}}

Every year, drug cartels and human smugglers operate with impunity, trafficking billions of dollars in narcotics and thousands of people into the United States. This documentary provides unique access to the elite police units on the front lines of this battle.\n\nWe follow the Maricopa County Sheriff's human smuggling unit (HSU) as they raid \"drophouses\" in Phoenix, properties where illegal immigrants are held in brutal conditions. We also go on a high-speed chase with the Nogales Police Department, seizing a massive haul of marijuana and a dangerous cache of weapons from drug runners. Finally, we witness a major FBI and SWAT operation to take down violent street gangs responsible for trafficking narcotics across the country.\n\nThis is a look at the relentless and often brutal fight to secure America's borders, where law enforcement battles a constantly evolving criminal underworld in an endless cycle of crime and enforcement.\n\nBorder Invasion Series 01 Episode 03\n\nWant to watch more docudramas? \nClick here: https://bit.ly/3ivnDhE\n\n#truestories #retold", "channel_title": "Documentary Vault", "published_at": "2025-08-30T20:00:11Z", "views": 31299, "likes": 194, "comment_count": 15, "duration_seconds": 2568, "keyword_relevance": {"must_hits": ["ice"], "should_hits": ["raid", "usa", "united states", "america", "immigrant", "immigrants", "illegal", "criminal", "gang", "border", "borders", "border patrol"], "score": 14}}

SOUNDBITE (English) Elliot Spagat, The Associated Press:\r\n++SOUNDBITE PARTIALLY COVERED++\r\n\"Greg Bovino has cut from a different cloth when it comes to U.S. Immigration authorities. He relishes the spotlight. He has a very active presence on social media. You see him wearing M4 assault rifles and full tactical gear, rap music playing in the background. He gets in public spats with officials who oppose the Trump administration's agenda. In a very short time, he's become a public face of the administration's efforts at mass deportation. We saw him first in Los Angeles, where he assumed the title of Border Patrol Commander-at-Large. From there, he went to Chicago. He went to Charlotte, North Carolina, New Orleans, most recently in Minneapolis. He's been in just about all of the major confrontational scenes that we've witnessed, maybe not all, but a significant percentage. He has been there on camera and enjoying it. In Chicago, just one example, a helicopter landed on the roof of an apartment building, agents repelling down the side of it. He was there, he was on Chicago's Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River. He's in the spotlight, in your face, and he makes no bones about it that the Border Patrol, he’s taken the Border Patrol's more aggressive tactics that we see on the border and making them much more common, and almost replacing ICE's more methodical, targeted approach, he calls it turn and burn. It's a system to get in quickly, make the arrest, rack them up, and get out before the protesters arrive.”\r\n\r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nARCHIVE: Charlotte, North Carolina - 17 November 2025\r\n3.

SOUNDBITE (English) Gregory Bovino, Border Patrol Commander: \r\n\"Our operations are lawful, they're targeted, and they're focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community. They are not random and they are not political. They are about removing criminals who are actively harming Minneapolis neighborhoods. For too long, residents have been told that enforcing our nation's immigration laws undermines public safety. In reality, the opposite is true. When the law is not enforced, violent offenders remain free. Criminal networks expand, and the community pays the price. Our neighbors, our citizens, our friends pay the price. Rather than confront that reality of which I've just spoken, leaders like Tim Walz or Mayor (Jacob) Frey have relied on heated rhetoric and accusations that distract from the facts.\" \r\n++EDIT ENDS ON SOUNDBITE++\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSenior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino said his agency is targeting people who pose a serious threat to the community during an immigration crackdown operation in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\"Our operations are lawful, they're targeted, and they're focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community,\" Bovino said during a press conference in Minneapolis Tuesday afternoon. \r\n\r\n\"They are not random and they are not political,\" he added. \r\n\r\nBovino, who has commanded the Trump administration's big-city immigration crackdown, said more than 10,000 people in the U.S. illegally have been arrested in Minnesota in the past year, including 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders\" in the last six weeks during Operation Metro Surge.\"\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

In this informative video, we will provide an overview of the detention center process, highlighting the various steps involved from the moment an individual arrives at the facility. Understanding how these centers operate is essential for grasping their role within the prison system. We will cover the initial screening process, which includes health and security checks, and how detainees are oriented to the facility's rules and procedures. \n\nDaily life in a detention center is structured around providing basic necessities such as food, clothing, and hygiene items. We will also discuss the importance of communication, including visitation rights and access to legal counsel, ensuring that detainees can maintain connections with their families and legal representatives. \n\nFor those in immigration detention, we will outline the hearings and interviews that determine their status, as well as the possibility of bond hearings. Additionally, we will touch on the standards that detention centers must follow regarding health care and safety, along with the oversight mechanisms in place to monitor conditions. \n\nJoin us for this detailed discussion, and subscribe to our channel for more informative content about the legal system and detention facilities.\n\n⬇️ Subscribe to our channel for more valuable insights.\n\n🔗Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@JailandPrisonInsider/?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n#DetentionCenter #PrisonSystem #LegalProcess #DetaineeRights #ImmigrationDetention #LegalCounsel #HealthAndSafety #DetentionLife #BondHearing #VisitationRights #DetaineeSupport #LegalStandards #DetentionFacilities #PrisonLife #CriminalJustice \n\nAbout Us: Welcome to Jail and Prison Insider, your trusted source for everything related to the jail and prison system.
