They earn $10k a year, then pay taxes on it, so they take home between $8,000 to $8,500.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026 if they quit, if they get fired, if they get arrested? They have to pay back the full $10k for their first month. It\u2019s called fine print, and morons don\u2019t know up to read very well. \n\nSo if they are doing this for three more years until the pedophile is out, they will be immediately fired by a decent cabinet officer, and they will then owe $40k, 15% of which they already paid taxes on, and the rest they already spent on porn and guns and penile enlargers. \n\nThey shall be screwed, without a job, with the worst resume in the history of America, and deeper in debt then when they were stupid enough to join the Gestapo. \n\nLovely, isn\u2019t it?",

I\u2019ve taken care of MAGAs, criminals, one guy who killed 2 people, my job is my job. Is it hard sometimes? Sure. And that\u2019s exactly why we say everyone isn\u2019t cut out for healthcare. If you can\u2019t provide that care to everyone regardless of what, if there\u2019s even an inkling doubt that you may have bias or discriminate, go work somewhere else. A rapist could\u2019ve been shot by his victim in the middle of the act and actively dying or heart stopped. I administer CPR. Not because he was a great person, and not because the victim deserved what happened. The ONLY time you don\u2019t administer CPR is if the person has a DNR. \n\nI\u2019m the last person in the world who like ICE. I\u2019ve said many times that I will go to jail if ICE comes to my facility rather than stand aside and let them have open season on my patients.

Now everyday folk are posting them in good faith.\n\nThey reference a Wired article, and videos of ICE agents telling protestors they\u2019re being \u201cadded to a list\u201d.\n\nA couple of things.\n\n1.\t\u2060Yes, this admin will attempt any dirty underhanded trick possible to quell protest and cheat the midterms. No doubt there is a list of actual patriots being complied by the actual domestic terrorists in this administration.\n\nHOWEVER\u2026\n\n2) The Wired article referenced doesn\u2019t say anyone was DENIED THE ABILITY TO FLY but rather they were not allowed to USE TSA PRECHECK STATUS which is not the same thing at all.\n\nAND\n\n3) The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AND DELETE ANYONE FROM STATE VOTER ROLLS \u2026 If they did, Bondi wouldn\u2019t be demanding access to the voter rolls in Minnesota as a condition to withdrawal ICE. Furthermore, they would be opening themselves up to the mother of all lawsuits.\n\nTHIS REEKS OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS PROTEST AND OPPOSITION TO ICE. DO NOT PRE-COMPLY WITH THE FASCISTS.",
