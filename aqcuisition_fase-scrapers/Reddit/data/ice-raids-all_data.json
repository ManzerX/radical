According to information relayed by the AP, the victims, all of Haitian nationality, were found at different points in this border area. Dominican authorities confirmed that only one of the bodies was discovered on Dominican territory, with the others found on the Haitian side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dominican police spokesman Diego Pesqueira said that Dominican law enforcement agencies had opened an investigation into the case discovered on their territory only, in accordance with the limits of their jurisdiction.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to preliminary findings, authorities believe the victims were killed before being thrown into a river. The current then carried the bodies to the locations where they were discovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; As part of the investigation, a man suspected of being linked to the case was arrested by the Dominican authorities. He denied any involvement. He was subsequently handed over to the Haitian National Police to continue legal proceedings.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Associated Press also reported that it had sought a response from the Haitian police, but had not received a reply at the time of publication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belly-Dave B\u00e9lizaire\n&gt; Vant B\u00e8f Info (VBI)",

      "text": "Call your House Rep and both Senators: (202) 224 3121 to hold firm on this:  \n  \nFebruary 4, 2026  \nThe Honorable Mike Johnson The Honorable John ThuneSpeaker Majority LeaderUnited States House of Representatives United States SenateH-232, The Capitol S-230, The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20510  \n  \nDear Speaker Johnson and Leader Thune:\n\nWe write with respect to fiscal year 2026 funding for the Department of Homeland Security(DHS). For months, the American people have watched in horror as U.S. Immigration andCustoms Enforcement (ICE) has terrorized communities across the country. After months ofescalation against everyday Americans and law-abiding immigrant families, two U.S. citizenswere killed in the streets of Minneapolis. Federal immigration agents cannot continue to causechaos in our cities while using taxpayer money that should be used to make life more affordablefor working families. \n\nThe American people rightfully expect their elected representatives to take action to rein in ICE and ensure no more lives are lost. It is critical that we come together toimpose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people aredemanding. We believe Congress needs to enact the following guardrails:  \n  \n**1. Targeted Enforcement** \u2013 DHS officers cannot enter private property without a judicialwarrant. End indiscriminate arrests and improve warrant procedures and standards.Require verification that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigrationdetention.\n\n**2. No Masks** \u2013 Prohibit ICE and immigration enforcement agents from wearing facecoverings.\n\n**3. Require ID** \u2013 Require DHS officers conducting immigration enforcement to display theiragency, unique ID number and last name. Require them to verbalize their ID number andlast name if asked.\n\n**4. Protect Sensitive Locations** \u2013 Prohibit funds from being used to conduct enforcementnear sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, child-care facilities,churches, polling places, courts, etc.\n\n**5. Stop Racial Profiling** \u2013 Prohibit DHS officers from conducting stops, questioning andsearches based on an individual\u2019s presence at certain locations, their job, their spokenlanguage and accent or their race and ethnicity.\n\n**6. Uphold Use of Force Standards** \u2013 Place into law a reasonable use of force policy,expand training and require certification of officers. In the case of an incident, the officermust be removed from the field until an investigation is conducted.\n\n**7. Ensure State and Local Coordination and Oversight** \u2013 Preserve the ability of State andlocal jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute potential crimes and use of excessive forceincidents. Require that evidence is preserved and shared with jurisdictions. Require the consent of States and localities to conduct large-scale operations outside of targetedimmigration enforcement.\n\n**8. Build Safeguards into the System** \u2013 Make clear that all buildings where people aredetained must abide by the same basic detention standards that require immediate accessto a person\u2019s attorney to prevent citizen arrests or detention. Allow states to sue DHS forviolations of all requirements. Prohibit limitations on Member visits to ICE facilitiesregardless of how those facilities are funded.\n\n**9. Body Cameras for Accountability, Not Tracking** \u2013 Require use of body-worn cameraswhen interacting with the public and mandate requirements for the storage and access offootage. Prohibit tracking, creating or maintaining databases of individuals participatingin First Amendment activities.\n\n**10. No Paramilitary Police** \u2013 Regulate and standardize the type of uniforms and equipmentDHS officers carry during enforcement operations to bring them in line with civil enforcement.\n\n  \n",

Johnathan Ross LEANED in TOWARD the vehicle, and grabbed the vehicle with his left hand.\n\nTwo shots as she was passing. That's murder. The autopsy showed a bullet through the left temple that exited out the right side of skull.\n\nIt looks like the second guy pulled the steering wheel toward him. (His elbow didn't bend to unlock the door.)\n\nThere have also been several deaths in ICE detention facilities that witnesses said were murder.\n\nAlso, in October 2025, a US Citizen was shot 5 times by Border Patrol, and here's a 60 Minutes clip about that shooting:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjc-ai\\_JbjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjc-ai_JbjQ)\n\nBruce Springsteen song: \"Streets of Minneapolis\":\n\n[Youtube.com/watch?v=wWKSoxG1K7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWKSoxG1K7w)\n\nAll this reminds me of \"4 Dead in Ohio\" and the My Lai Massacre, and the murderers that weren't charged for these. This also reminds me of the murder of Harvey Milk and another man going unpunished.  And even Bombingham and Byron de la Beckwith, and so many other Southerner murderers that weren't charged, including some not for decades.\n\n(And about their propaganda about that: Most white Southerners changed from the Democrat Party to the Republican Party in the mid-twentieth century during the civil rights movement. For example, segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond changed from the Democrat Party to the Republican Party in 1964, because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.)\n\nThere's information on my profile and linked pages.

If everything you do is aboveboard, you have no need for a mask. Their demand for masks is especially rich since they themselves are doxxing anyone they can with the phones and facial recognition software and compiling databases and removing people's TSA recheck status based on that doxxing, etc.\n\nThe first time I saw cops with their identification removed while on duty was in the protests in Ferguson.

That doesn't mean she'll wholesale be anti-Israel, let alone anti-Zionist. This is a nauseating argument anyway, I don't even think she has ever defended the settlers there. Also, there are over a million Palestinian nationals in Israel who could just vote against Netanyahu's party, yet they do not. My problem with so much online discourse on this topic is those of you who completely lose it over imperfect allies like Jamie Lee Curtis while you have so little or possess misconstrued knowledge on Israel/Palestine.\n\nEither way, that's not to dismiss the warcrimes of Netanyahu, whose admin should be put in the Hague. Now that Trump kidnapped Maduro, the Euronations should just do that with Netanyahu at this point. Only seems fair!",

That's why they keep on saying don't bite us. But the physical intimidation of walking around with all that gear says exact opposite \n\nI watched a video about someone who was in the military stating in order to have good relationships with the local citizens they didn't walk around in all that gear. They walked around with their face present and being able to tell the people their name in order to gain trust and build trust. What ice is doing with the gear that they have is not building. Trust it's building fear",

Law enforcement can trample your rights, damage your property, assault you, and then submit intentionally false statements that are proven untrue to try to get you convicted of a crime, and then in 99% of cases the best outcome the victim can expect is that those charges fall apart in court. They've still suffered damages and they still had to fight it, and at no cost to the officer who put them through all that. Officers can use this method as a tool to punish people at will because no matter the outcome, their target is still harmed and cannot expect any recompense. ",

The goal is to keep people informed about real, ongoing events that have serious consequences.\n\nWhile many members here share strong opinions about MAGA, Trump, and law enforcement more broadly, standalone posts about Trump or law enforcement that do not directly involve ICE are off topic and will be removed. If a post does not involve ICE operations, policy, or enforcement, it does not belong here.\n\nAdditionally, memes and AI generated content are not permitted as posts. This subreddit is meant to maintain a serious, informational tone. Memes and jokes tend to undermine that purpose. If you want to share humor or commentary, you are welcome to do so in comment sections, but posts should remain focused on informing the community.\n\nWe appreciate everyone who contributes responsibly and helps keep this space useful, accurate, and grounded in reality.\n\nr/Ice\\_Raids Mod Team",

Then they just left after a scuffle with said dad of the house.\n\nThey are egging the 2nd on, and they know once someone uses their right- they will take it as a green light to upgrade to full military occupation, not just cosplay. But I implore you to keep calm, protected, and express your rights. At the very least, catch it on camera to show the tyrant of the states. You\u2019ll have the majority of the American people on your side- what that is worth in today\u2019s political currency is a mixed bag.\n\nKeep cameras up and rolling, conduct yourself as someone who knows they are being filmed would, keep your dogs at bay and away (the have noem as a leader- so our fur babies are targets at will), tell your family to keep hands to themselves (or at their side *wink* ), and proceed as if the world is watching.\n\nI can\u2019t say for certain that there won\u2019t be more tragic stories. Unfortunately today\u2019s climate only appears to care, but when a martyr is created, the will of the people seems to but flurried up then. Stay safe. Stay protected.

      "author": "Appropriate_Egg6866",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "&gt;\n\n&gt;Most people have no idea that the company behind ChatGPT is now one of the biggest funders of Donald Trump\u2019s political machine. OpenAI\u2019s president, Greg Brockman, recently gave $25 million to MAGA Inc, making him the largest tech donor of the fundraising cycle.\n\n&gt;And it gets much worse. ICE is now using OpenAI\u2019s technology to screen job applicants for its deportation operations. According to internal sources, this has already led to untrained recruits being sent into the field. Meanwhile, OpenAI helped launch a $100 million Super PAC dedicated to destroying state-level AI safety laws. They want to ensure that only the federal government (read: Trump) gets to write the rules for the most powerful new technology on earth.\n\n&gt;Now here\u2019s what OpenAI doesn\u2019t want you to know: they\u2019re vulnerable. Very vulnerable. They\u2019ve already dropped from 87% market share to 65% in a single year. They spend three dollars for every dollar they bring in. Their entire business model depends on you believing there\u2019s no alternative. But Claude exists, Gemini exists, open-source alternatives like Confer, Alpine and Lumo exist, and most people who try them say they\u2019re just as good or better.\n\n&gt;Yes, the other companies have their issues too. But OpenAI is in a league of its own \u2013 both in how badly they behave and how exposed they are. ChatGPT\u2019s users are relatively young and most of them are unaware of any of this. Most would never knowingly fund Trump\u2019s biggest tech donor, or a company that helps ICE, or a product that tells children how to end their lives. They just don\u2019t know yet.\n\n&gt;So let\u2019s tell them. Share this video. Let\u2019s make an example of ChatGPT, and show Silicon Valley what people power can do.\n\n&gt;Join the grassroots movement now: [QuitGPT.org](http://QuitGPT.org)\n\nText from Rutger Bregman: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUVlYXBjdmf/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUVlYXBjdmf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==)",

You wanna rebel by consumer spending? Don't fund the Maga nazi-salute-rendering dickhead. Get off X. Don't buy Teslas. \n\n3.) How many people actually have ChatGPT subscriptions? It's also a multinational company. The handful of Americans that have ChatGPT subs cancelling their ChatGPT subs doesn't effect their global business. \n\n4.) You think these companies are contributing to the Trump campaign because they support the administration? They're doing it out of fear of backlash because the whole administration is corrupt and petty. They're playing the game they have to play. Vote out the administration (assuming they let us vote)\n\n5.) This rhetoric of \"they are not a cashflow positive company\" is something parrotted around by completely financially illiterate morons. The overwhelming majority of startups are not cashflow positive for years. It's literally how this works.\n\n6.) Of course they're losing market share. They were first to market. Meaning they went from having 0 competitors to having 0+X competitors. No shit sherlock. \n\n  \nThere's many reasons to be anti OpenAI. The one's mentioned in the post are not among them. ",

Recent deaths by ICE are committed by our government with orders to go against the constitution and overuse power, abduct people and separate families without warrants (thanks Stephen Miller), and much worse. People pool in the streets when their rights as a nation are threatened and that is what happened. When law enforcement or the government itself is killing us, people protest. If the narrative is then that because Laken (and many others) were killed by criminal record holding violent illegal immigrants then everyone would be in support of deporting \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2026 that is NOT what is happening and THAT is why everyone is up in arms! How else is this supposed to make sense. Aaaaand if we want to protest in the streets for women being killed by men in general I am all for it. We maybe should just deport all men considering they commit over 85% of violent crimes and US citizen men are more likely to commit crime than \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d\n\nhttps://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU01/20250122/117827/HHRG-119-JU01-20250122-SD004.pdf\n\n\\*\\*Men commit the vast majority of violent crimes, accounting for 80-90% of such offenses, with 90% of homicides committed by men.  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/42tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table\\_42\\_arrests\\_by\\_sex\\_2012.xls",

He has proven he has racial bias and is a violent individual, so he should not at all be working there.\n\nHis job is evil already, but that doesn't mean they can't do anything.

Wagner, Mossad, who else ? I find it odd that even MAGA patriots could so easily kill people like that (even if MAGA are dumbass) I find ICE behavior / abuse / tactics and unapologetic standing too similar from what we usually see in genocidal countries likes Israel or Russia, even Cartels.\n\nIs there plausibility to this theory ? Could it be possible to take control even partially of another country\u2019s military group (while the president is compromised and protect it) ? Did it happened historically in other countries ? Is it a strategy that has already been used elsewhere ?\n\nI\u2019m curious what you think about , just something I can\u2019t stop thinking about since the last few days.",

Look into our nation's labor movement and the tons of gun battles, massacres, and **the first time in the world that bombs were ever dropped from a plane**. Those were striking workers calling for a fair shake, and they eventually won. This was after our Civil war. We stand at the precipice of an equal, if not more terrible moment.\n\nWe in the USA have a *Horrible* memory. We tend to forget some really important stuff that got us our goodies and freedoms, we forget about all the mass deaths we caused around the world through our endless interventions to destroy any challenge to capitalism, we forget that Leftist policy pulled our nation out of despair multiple times in the 20th century. \n\nI'm armed and armored as a deterrent, nations have nuclear weapons as deterrents. It's the only reason North Korea has not been fucked with. Carrying arms and defending the constitution domestically with a few comrades in your district isn't going to start or end any civil war or real engagement, but it may put tyranny on notice.",

It\u2019s not ICE as a whole you hate, just one branch of it.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is often misunderstood because it is actually comprised of two distinct branches with very different missions. Most of the public's apprehension stems from Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which is the branch responsible for the arrest, detention, and deportation of individuals for immigration violations. \n\nHowever, the other half of the agency is Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which operates as a massive criminal investigative body. HSI focuses on dismantling transnational threats that have little to do with standard immigration status, such as human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, and child exploitation. Distinguishing between the two is key: while ERO handles the controversial \"ER\" (Enforcement and Removal) side, HSI serves as a vital tool against serious global crime.",

She won't take them at their word, she said: \"Not with this presidential administration, and not with ICE in particular.\"\n\nThe concern come as a coalition of community organizations across the Bay Area holds rallies, marches, and protests during Super Bowl week, fearing that the Big Game's heavy security presence and previous mixed messaging from federal officials could also bring heightened enforcement by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security while the sports world is watching.\n\nRead more: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/04/no-ice-super-bowl-san-francisco-cautious/88472754007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/04/no-ice-super-bowl-san-francisco-cautious/88472754007/)",

      "author": "000Ronald",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "From the article, \n\n&gt;Walz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\n&gt;Lewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n&gt;\u201cStudents are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cStaff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.\u201d\n\nIt seems like ICE are desperate to pick a fight on people weaker than them. Or maybe since it's come out that everyone in the Trump administration is either a pedophile or running cover for pedophiles, they're just trying to show Big Orange Daddy their real colors. Either way, it's something that bodes exceptionally poorly. \n\nGiven that context, it is also noteworthy that ICE has started roughing up people who follow them around to warn people of their presence. Again, quoting from the article(emphasis mine),\n\n&gt;A federal judge last month put [limits on how officers](https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-immigration-operation-lawsuit-8805b301ff4a7bfb0058e085ffa8c034) treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents \u201cat an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,\u201d the judge said. **An appeals court, however, set the order aside.**\n\nSo a court gave protections to the people going out and warning people about ice protections, but another court said that ICE does not need accountability. We see here again an instance where the law has explicitly failed to protect peaceful protesters, which empowers ICE to commit acts of cruelty and brutality. ",

That\u2019s after the count was culled nearly in half as a result of Supreme Court rulings and Covid.

There are too many times exceptions are made because congress or the president said it needs to be done. That is not how the constitution works. Also sadly we need laws that outline the punishments and we should start at the top. Presidents should not be above the law period. So many times in US history has a president made an order that would land them in jail if a normal person. I understand it is easy to say exceptions should be made when but hear me out NO. Exceptions is what has brought us here. A fascist president has found his American SS.

It was a play by play of the Nazi lead up to power.\n\nAnd the fucked up thing? When the few people who saw what could happen and called it out, tried to warn people? We got shut down. Nobody wanted to listen.\n\nAnd now, all this shit that we knew could happen IS happening...all because people don't want to listen when they're warned and told to go look it up for themselves so that they could see the connections too and realize what a dangerous path that Drumpy pants wanted to go down.\n\nIt's horrible, knowing that all of this could have been stopped if only people had fucking listened and read up on history a little bit.",

Whatever they say your response should always be a question probing for more.

The mayor and its council held a public meeting on monday and have stated publicly that:\n\nA) They DO NOT want this thing here.\nB) There has been no contact with the city about the building being purchased.\n\nYou'd think the lack of contact would be a good thing, but ICE has been moving under the radar, and the federal government operates on a different level nationally, so they can make zoning decisions without local input or awareness. If you have doubts, I implore you to look into Surprise, Arizona. A facility was purchased out there for the same prpose and the stories coming out of there are deplorable if not already covered up. \n\nThis is a community that DOES NOT WANT THIS. I'm sure there are plenty of people around the area who agree.\n\nHutchins has a population of 6,000. It's a speck on the map, especially compared to Dallas.\nThe warehouse can hold tens of thousands (if they aren't just gonna ignore fire safety codes and cram more people in there anyways) AND it's gonna cost millions to keep running. This eyesore is going to kill more than just a single community and it's going to cost SO much money doing so.\n\nIf you are able, I am imploring as many people to show up as possible. \nWe need numbers, we need voices, we need to  show that its not JUST Hutchins\nEven if you dont have a speech, even if you just stand there-  there will be cameras and witnesses and we need to show not only the Mayor, but all of Dallas that we have numbers and that we care.\n\nIf you can't come, please spread word. Please share this post and any info. I will continue to post as more meetings and events happen.\nThere is another meeting happening in Hutchins TOMORROW AT 6!!\n\nFebruary 4 @ 18:00 \n400 J J Lemmon RD \nHutchins, TX 75141 \n\nBe there! Be safe! F*CK ICE. ",

These paramilitary tactical units behave not like local police, but instead like special forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, or other far-flung battlefields from the Forever Wars of the past quarter century.\n\nAmid the widespread, hostile confrontations with concerned citizens in Minneapolis, the unusually aggressive conduct of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s tactical teams have led to two killings: ICE SRT agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good on January 7, while CBP SRT agent Raymundo Gutierrez was [identified by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez) as one of the two masked feds who shot and killed Pretti.\n\nThe brutal tactics of SRT and BORTAC units seem to have spread into ICE and CBP as a whole. Over the last year, these DHS agencies have morphed into a masked, seemingly unaccountable force that detains children, separates families, blows open doors, snatches teachers and parents from schools and day care centers, and [kills unarmed protesters](https://www.wired.com/story/why-ice-can-kill-with-impunity/) who were [simply voicing dissent](https://www.wired.com/story/the-campaign-to-destroy-renee-good/) or [recording the mayhem](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-film-ice/). In [16 shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/27/ice-border-patrol-shootings-immigration-trump/) involving Department of Homeland Security personnel since July, none have faced state or federal charges, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/ice-cbp-srt-bortac-units-immigration-operations/](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-cbp-srt-bortac-units-immigration-operations/)",

Last I checked we were on good terms and planning the next time to hang out. And I\u2019m worried his socials I follow him on are silent. I tried reaching out to his sister but no response. It\u2019s been about a month without a response or reply and i worry about my friend, we weren\u2019t super close but we\u2019d hang out occasionally and talk. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on non speaking terms, if so he\u2019d probably give me a reason for radio silence\u2026We were just friends who were LGBTQ+ , played video games, and enjoyed Marvel media. I didn\u2019t want to assume but I\u2019m worried some ICE agents took him and his family the (Martinez\u2019s) \u2026 I hate ice and I hope I can hear from my friend soon \u2026 I miss hanging out with him, am I wrong to be pondering that ICE may have something to do with his absence???

      "author": "It_Could_Be_True",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "Ammon Bundy, once the most recognizable face of the right-wing militia movement, is increasingly isolated from his former allies due to his outspoken criticism of the Trump regime\u2019s thuggery. Bundy became prominent through two armed standoffs with federal agents, which made him a leading figure in the Patriot Movement, embraced by anti-government extremists, 2nd Amendment maximalists, and even some mainstream conservatives.\n\nIn November, Bundy published an essay calling the regime\u2019s treatment of undocumented immigrants a \u201cmoral failure.\u201d He wrote, \u201cTo call such people criminals for lacking official permission \u2026 is to forget the moral law of God, the historical truth of our own founding, and the Constitutional ideals that continue to define justice.\u201d After the killing of Renee Good in Minnesota, Bundy said ICE\u2019s conduct \u201cclearly looks like tyranny.\u201d In a conversation with the author, Bundy expressed shock at the violence and said, \u201cWhen it comes to the more humanitarian side of it, I think the left has it much more correct than the nationalist right.\u201d\n\nHis past included leading a 2014 standoff with the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada with his father, Cliven Bundy, and a six-week 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that ended with a rancher\u2019s death. He later faced a protracted legal fight in Idaho over a defamation judgment.\n\nWhile Bundy\u2019s earlier activism once drew attention from outlets like Fox News and sympathy from elements of the Republican Party, his critique of immigration policy now alienates many within the militia world. Some former allies refuse to condemn ICE\u2019s actions or even praise agents involved in violent incidents, and a few dismiss Bundy\u2019s principled defense of equal rights for immigrants as contradictory to their current priorities. Bundy himself acknowledges feeling \u201ca little bit alone\u201d as he finds his former community diverging from the principles that once united them.",

Yes they are undocumented but are they not humans? \n\nI am not trying to advocate for undocumented immigrants nor allowing them in to our country without proper documentation however, I wondering about how humane is the treatment to those humans at the border? \n\nWhat we are experiencing may be new to us but not new for these federal police and routine and it sends a chill through my spine just of thinking how badly they are treating the people in desperate situations. \n\n  \nI hope this will stop soon here and there too \ud83d\ude4f",

Remember that those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. DHS and ICE are preparing to decamp and move their travelling horror show to Ohio, where their intended purpose and guiding policies will be directed into their latest pogrom. \n\nThere, their stated intent is to deport the Haitian population and other people of color. In preparation for this atrocity the regime has administratively removed the Temporary Protected Status from our friends and neighbors there. \n\nAre we going to allow the regime to continue to drag the nation into the darkness and repression of fascism and authoritarianism, or are we ready to take a stand against everything this republic was designed to protect against, to say loudly, \"Enough!\" and to follow those who fought against this national blight before us? Rise up, find your voice and join those of us who've had enough. Remember that freedom is not free, and must be watered by the blood and sweat of patriots to thrive and grow. Don't lose sight of the fact that WE greatly outnumber THEM. If we forget, we lose.\n\nSic semper tyrannis! Illigitimi non carborundum!",

I know you've been trained that you can just break windows and that you don't need judicial warrants, but your leadership is lying to you. Don't believe me. You guys should put your money together and hire a criminal defense lawyer for an hour to explain to you how you are committing felonies daily. It's called \"deprivation of rights under color of law\". Write that down. I'm serious, you guys. You are being set up to go to prison. This kind of stuff you're doing now has never worked out well for people like you. There will be trials like the Nuremburg trials, you should probably have someone explain those to you too. It's the little guys like you who always pay the price while leadership walks free.  Do you really think leadership respects you and is telling you the truth? Seriously, get ten of you together and pony up about 20 bucks each to talk to a criminal defense lawyer. 50 bucks each if you want to talk to a good one. I'm not here to argue with you, just giving you some good advice because you are clearly believing the lies being told to you and you don't want to end up in prison.\"",

They want to destroy people\u2019s lives and break their minds. They do not deserve a second of peace. They don\u2019t deserve to exist in a community without crippling anxiety to the point of fearing to show their faces. They don\u2019t deserve to be loved, to know joy or solace, fellowship, belonging, or to have any control over anyone or anything. \n\nThey need to be ostracized from society, condemned somewhere solitary where their influence can burn out like a tired candle. They need their assets redistributed to relief funds for the trauma they\u2019ve sown into the world. They need to have their networks rooted out and prosecuted. They need to have amendments added to whatever future documents of law might abide in the people again to prevent terrorism such as theirs from ever forming again. \n\nAnd it still won\u2019t be enough. The shame though, proffered in abundance, rained on them at every encounter, will be delightful. Make the shame sink into their bones until it\u2019s the only thing keeping their body moving. Make it the only interaction they ever have again. Let it eat them alive until their eyes close for the last time. \n\nUnleash the unrelenting shame on these people. They are unfit to be included in our future.",

Just like Ice got a crazy huge budget, the resistance needs one as well. Right now it\u2019s non profits and people living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nFood, water, warming/cooling shelters) medical tents, etc. Off the line, community events for how to organize, 2A, how we can actually get our politicians to do something or get out of the way. Even if not funding, A LOUDER VOICE, speak to their fan base and let them know where these things happen and why all this is wrong in the first place.

Only when those in power fear the consequences of their actions will we be safe. \n\nLet the facts speak for themselves. If we are stopped when attempting to render life saving aid by using scissors or a knife to clearly cut away clothing and apply a tourniquet to someone who is mortally wounded, then they will once again successfully expose themselves for the inhumane monsters they are. This is why the gestapo is terrified of people filming and capturing the truth of what is happening. They know that what they are doing is so unconscionable and that anyone watching will be repulsed by their actions. Good, let\u2019s keep filming. \n\nWhen the everyday person sees the atrocities the commit, they need not read any theory, or understand an ideology, because they can see with their own eyes the injustice that is happening. This is why the murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti was so impactful for many around the world. \n\nEdit: typos",

Their name is HLI Partners LLC, located in Winter Park. They are working with ICE to fast track the deal this week. Warehouse already had barricades installed this week.",
      "author": "swagonflyyyy",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "Here is evidence of their involvement: https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/8660-Transport-Dr-Orlando-FL/27264110/\n\nIf you want to point your anger at someone, you can start with these people, not the warehouse. The warehouse isn't the enemy here, it was just built to spec for industrial zoning from the start.\n\nTPA Group (the developer based in GA) and HLI Partners (The Broker) sold their souls to the frozen devil to quickly turn a profit on a warehouse with tax benefits in Tavistock's territory that is only a year old. They wanted to pretend they could slip right under the public's eye and guarantee a steady stream of federal income at the expense of the community's safety and well-being.\n\nTPA Group has been radio silent, but the fact that the warehouse already has barricades mounted and Republican officials visiting the site to defend its use signals that they're already feeling the heat. It really makes me wonder who actually mounted the barricades there if a deal hasn't been signed with ICE. Was it TPA Group? Tavistock? ICE? HLI Partner's CEO's wife's boyfriend? Who knows? But the fact they let it happen confirms they're in on it.\n\nBut let's focus on the broker here, not TPA group nor the warehouse. Who are these guys? They're a relatively young brokerage founded in 2023 containing only a handful of staff for the entire firm. This small team of brokers already generated ~$2 billion in revenue selling huge industrial real estate to a handful of legitimate clients.\n\nTheir office building is hidden, quietly tucked away in a tiny little rich corner of Winter Park across the street from the police station, the fire department and none other than Rockefeller Capital. The building itself is a multi-office building with about a dozen firms inside.\n\nEntrance is in the back, not the front, and HLI Partner's name is suspiciously absent from the signs listing the rest of the firms holed up inside that building yet that is indeed their one and only headquarters they operate out of.\n\nThese sleazy parasites believe they can pull a fast one on the people of Orlando for a quick buck and that no one would notice the kind of grave mistake they are making to the community. These people need to be exposed and shown the door. So please, do Orlando and Winter Park a favor and spread the word.\n\nThese people are the ones responsible for ICE even entertaining the idea of building a concentration camp in our backyard, right next to the airport. Expect ICE to accelerate their plans once the word spreads. More on this soon!\n\n**UPDATE: Its having an effect! The listing in the link has been updated today to remove the names of all the staff except for one staff member! The pressure is getting to them! They're trying to run and hide!!!**",

Which I will remind everyone that this is what american is supposed to be. \nWe are a country of immagrants. \nUnless you are a native American you family most likely has an imagrant in the tree. Or even worse you could go back to the colonizers from England.  \n\nThe January 30 strike was a good idea but it was to short notice and not greatly organized. \n\nWe have 6 months and social media and the internet to cancel independence day.\n\nAnd I have plans.\n\nIt starts with canceling parades and firework displayd one city, county and state at a time.\nNo buying any decorations.\nNo buying any food for the first 4 days of July. \nNo buying anything unless it's emergency for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th of july. No gas. no cloths. no food. drinks.alcohol. weed. NOTHING!\nDon't decorate for Independence day. \nNo stars and stripes.\nNo red, white and blue.\nNo personal fireworks even if you have some left over from a previous year.\nIt's just about not spending money it's about sending a message. \nThe sky must be dark, the air must be silent. No rockets red glare.\nNo organized sporting events for the first 4 days of July the the national anthem should remain unsung.\n\nIf possible no work for the 1st 2nd 3rd if your job already gives you off on those days don't work the day you were supposed to be back.\n\nIf we can't get the parade and fireworks canceled in your state, city or county have a protest, sit in or some type of peaceful disruption of the parade and firework display.\n\nUse social media. \nLike use that shit against them.\n\nGot 100 followers on your tik tok spread the word. \nHave a favorite Podcaster or other content creator who focus on political protests or really anyone against what is going on in this country right now send them this. Send them the petitions to cancel both the fireworks display and parade in their area.\n\nCall your local politicians.\n\nFind the local businesses that do not support ICE or even better do not support the hatred and violence or MAGA and support those businesses. (I know this one is especially hard I am disabled and on a fixed income so I really don't have enough to be picky about where I buy my needs but I am going to try. )\n\nTalk to your friends.\nTalk to strangers if you feel it's safe.\nWear you thoughts, make t-shirts or hats even with \nDEFUND I.C.E.! \nRELEASE THE TRUMP-STEIN FILES! \nDUMP TRUMP!\nmost importantly be safe. We see the violence these monsters are doing with near impunity let's be vigilant and careful about how we dismantle with rotting travesty. \n\n",

If you decide to take one I want to make sure you are effective with it. If you try to blow a whistle and find only a weak high-pitched howl comes from it you are not blowing into it correctly. To make a whistle loud you must purse your lips around it and put the tip of your tongue against the mouth piece. You want to blow a sharp burst of air into it which could be short or long. The most similar action is blowing up a balloon, you need a tight seal and strong wind. Practice until you get it and you\u2019ll know when you do.\n\n**This post was removed from my city\u2019s reddit page and I continued to attempt to post until I was banned from posting there.** I want to disseminate it elsewhere as I know many places are utilizing whistles.

This is the mother to my brother's girlfriend, she came here from Venezuela nearly ten years ago and brought her daughters a few years after that. She followed all paperwork necessary for residency status until she heard stories of friends being deported when they went to file their paperwork. Due to this, she was detained walking from her car to her home on December 22 and was just recently released. She has been unable to work and has been confined to her home since release due to fear of another interaction with ICE (even though she is already following the terms of her bail). There's no need to give thoughts, prayers, or political arguments here but if you find it in your heart to give a couple bucks to help with legal fees id appreciate it immensely! Feel free to share wherever you want.\n",

After tracking them for about 20 miles through multiple highways and several lane changing maneuvers, we ended up in a quiet suburb. \n\nThe driver peeled off into residential streets and began hitting the gas upwards into 50+ MPH. I stopped following them and parked my car on a side street. After waiting for a minute I saw them come down the road to the main highway in the area. So I got behind them again. After following them back into the same neighborhood again, the driver stopped and quickly whipped around to get in front of me and I slowly approached. \n\nThat's when he threatened to arrest me citing some BS statute. He traveled on and then I continued to safely follow until I lost them a couple minutes later.\n\nThese MAGA thugs seriously need to GTFO of MN. I will keep following them until they do. ",

She focused on defending our most vulnerable among us from exploitation in the criminal justice system. As she began her career in the Bowie County Public Defender's Office, she worked tirelessly to keep children safe and out of jail. Her time there serves as a reminder that criminal justice is an intersectional issue.*",

It's always \"Orange man bad as seen in files,\" but usually more extreme, or \"woke\" with whatever rhyming word and some rainbow color filter over whatever scene. Just insults that have no chance of reaching their intended target.\n\nI'm looking for the adults in the conversation. The entire system is jacked and it's getting worse. All the while everyone is staring at the jiggling keys, or jiggling them, while the protagonists carry on.\n\nTrying to say the biggest cluster of words that might offend the 1 person described, while it's only reaching a group that is either for or against it, is simply baiting or gaining like-minded people. This, I presume, just for another mix of words until the most offensive can be crowned. I am sure there are tons of subreddits for this.\n\nAnyone wanting to truly discuss anything would be likened to someone trying to get through either mob. And what I am saying isn't any part towards the post's narrative because I'm playing a zero sum game to try to get people to realize that they're just not accomplishing anything.\n\nHopes are to find some reasonable people for discourse before getting lynched. But Reddit is more of an entertainment site than anywhere I would trust much. Anyone with any claims gets bombarded with citing requests which is valid on the site.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to gain, on reddit sadly enough, is for people to allow just 1 thread on a topic for civil people not trying to jump around like a new jack in prison. And I said \"prison\" not making any pun referring to these \"camps.\"\n\n![gif](giphy|ewoxzfNUxNH6mYrBZL|downsized)",

For all you know, most of these children could be (and likely are) legal U.S. citizens, but they are being separated from their families and forced to live in squalid conditions. Does that really sit well with you? Need I remind you that in the United States, **every person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law**.\n\n&gt;\u201dThe constitution is being upheld show me where a judge has ruled otherwise in the last 90 days\u201d\n\nHere is an article published November 28th, 2025: [More than 220 judges have now rejected the Trump admin\u2019s mass detention policy](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/28/trump-detention-deportation-policy-00669861).\n\n&gt;*The Trump administration\u2019s bid to systematically lock up nearly all immigrants facing deportation proceedings has led to a fierce \u2014 and mounting \u2014 rejection by courts across the country.*\n\n&gt;*That effort, which began with an abrupt policy change by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on July 8, has led to a tidal wave of emergency lawsuits after ICE\u2019s targets were arrested at workplaces, courthouses or check-ins with immigration officers. Many have lived in the U.S. for years, and sometimes decades, without incident and have been pursuing asylum or other forms of legal status.*\n\n&gt;***At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration\u2019s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process.*** *Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents \u2014 including 23 by Trump himself \u2014 and hail from at least 35 states, according to a POLITICO analysis of thousands of recent cases. The number of judges opposing the administration\u2019s position has more than doubled in less than a month.*\n\nAnd here is an article published January 24th, 2026: [Immigrant families protest at Texas facility housing 5-year-old boy, father detained in Minnesota](https://apnews.com/article/texas-immigration-detention-7fa98244c1b0245deb4462e9dc25292f#).\n\n&gt;*Hundreds of children have been held at the facility beyond the court-mandated limit, according to a report filed December by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an ongoing federal lawsuit.*\n\nKeep in mind we are talking about *children* here.\n\n&gt;\u201dThese are not internment camps but nice way of labeling them as such to re-label everything to make it more evil and scary so that weak minds follow suit against evil\u201d\n\nOkay, what would you call them then?\n\n&gt;\u201dImmigration cases are civil rather than criminal proceedings\u201d\n\nThis makes no sense. Illegally entering the country is a ***misdemeanor criminal*** offense. Being in the country legally when a visa expires is a *civil* offense, which rarely warrants jail time. What is even your point here?\n\n&gt;\u201daliens have limited due process rights as defined by Congress and Supreme Court precedents.\u201d\n\n[The Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) would beg to differ.\n\n&gt;***No person*** *shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger;* ***nor shall any person*** *be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,* ***nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law***; *nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.*",

At least 1,000 children were held longer than 20 days, a court-ordered limit on child detention.\n\n\u201cEvery single day that a kid is in a place like this, they deteriorate,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen \\[them\\] withdraw. They lose weight; they just get physically worse.\u201d\n\n\"In court documents, families have described [horrific conditions while detained with their children](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/12/17/children-immigration-detention-dilley-ice) in Dilley. They reported moldy, worm-filled food and foul-tasting, undrinkable water. With little for children to do, some resorted to playing with rocks. Parents worried about the psychological toll of detention, describing children hitting themselves in their faces or wetting themselves despite being potty-trained.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before we see a child die within Dilley or another facility,\u201d Kumpf said.\n\n\"Hayam El-Gamal and her five children, including [5-year-old twins](https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-hayam-and-her-children-back-home), have been locked inside Dilley for eight grueling months. Lee, who represents the family, said they\u2019ve received poor medical care and are suffering from psychological stress.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling me crying every day,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unmitigated horror show, and there\u2019s no other way to put it.\u201d\"",

I know exactly how much I can physically push myself before I need to take a break, as an example. We tend to be very aware of our limitations and what we can and cannot do. \n\n  Oddly, it's others who tend to push limits on me - and it can be upsetting when this happens, although I know that it usually comes from them trying to be nice and helpful. Generally though, if I need help, I'll ask for it, ya know? It can actually make things more difficult, or even dangerous, if someone tries to 'help' me do something that I'm already in the process of doing.

These tech companies that are creating AI solutions to displacing human labor are treasonous fucking betrayers of humankind. There is no UBI coming, no universal healthcare, no rescue of the laborers for who this will be devastating. Just a digital reality for the rich and a US class based caste system that punishes the poor for not making the right financial choices or having the right opportunity.\n\nIf you don't think AI is \"there yet\" or could \"ever displace workers at that scale\" you aren't paying attention to the improvements, the speed of deployment, and level of investment in the AI industry. It's not just about art and music, it's workers in every industry that are being devastated by humanoid robots. We are looking at day after day of recursive improvements that exponentially change the way labor in America has power. Once laborers can no longer striker or protest then the power of the labor unions and working class is gone. It is a race among these massive, hideous tech companies to displace as many workers in the American workforce as they can, whoever wins this race positions themselves at the top of the next 20 years of business. It's a fucking disgusting death cult this country has become occupied by.\n\nICE will be one of the forces policing the mass unemployment and rioting taking place with advanced technology like Palantir and more AI related tactics. That's why they are buying warehouses across the country that are 800k sq ft. and gearing up for these massive operations. Once people can't find a job because the computers can do it better, they will be forced to fend for themselves economically which means that most people will have to resort to law breaking behavior to feed their families.\n\nThe whole ICE thing is not for immigrants, people.",

He was in a black early 2000s truck (very much not standard looking gov vehicle) and in civilian clothes. \n\nHe spoke to some workers in the neighborhood who are Hispanic and was asking them questions about hiring them for work and if they lived at the house and who owned it and stuff like that. \n\nI\u2019m assuming it was an ICE agent scouting the neighborhood but am not sure if these are similar tactics that others have noticed.

It\u2019s $10k per year. Before taxes, so really like $6k.\n\nBut there are clauses.\n\nIf you are fired for any reason, you have to pay it back whatever you received.

We have been told it\u2019s business as usual which I do understand, leaving mid-work day is obviously a problem. But jeez. What I\u2019d give to join because I can\u2019t stand what these villains are doing to innocent people. I wish I could help the kids in some way. Already planning to let them go with zero obstruction when they march out at the designated time, not doing any shopping today or any of that. Just sucks I can\u2019t do more lest I risk my job. Anyways sorry, just wanted a place to vent and say fuck ice\n\nEdit: thank you to hyper-object who I feel said it best. By joining, it would likely dismiss the message from the students\u2019 perspective. I plan to give tips on safety and knowing their rights as they go to leave today. Thanks for the multiple perspectives in this thread, especially the ones that understand the difficulty of my position as there\u2019s sadly a lot that goes into being a teacher beyond \u201cteach the kids\u201d",

      "title": "Constitutional lawyer and Rep. Harriet Hageman (R) cuts short Casper town hall after contentious exchanges over ICE killings",
      "author": "AfricanMan_Row905",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "The congresswoman faced questions about the shootings of Alex Pretti and Ren\u00e9e Good, saying she\u2019d have to see a completed investigation, drawing shouts and insults.\n\nICE actions, prompted an escalating back-and-forth between questioners, the congresswoman and the audience at Casper College\u2019s Wheeler Concert Hall while a half-dozen policemen stood guard.\n\nA young man who said he was a Casper College student quizzed her about the killings. Hageman responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked about that. I spoke about the Laken Riley Act because it was one of the bills that we passed. I haven\u2019t talked about what was going on in Minnesota.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Why is that?\u201d the student asked. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you said that you condemn the violence or given condolences to the families of the victims?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been the topic that we\u2019ve been talking about today,\u201d Hageman answered over rising jeers from the audience. \n\n\u201cSo I think what has happened in Minnesota is a terrible tragedy for the woman and the man who were killed,\u201d she said, referring to U.S. citizens Alex Pretti, shot dead on Saturday, and Ren\u00e9e Good, shot dead on Jan. 7.\n\nThe student walked out of the concert hall, shouting retorts at the congresswoman as others applauded.\n\nCasper residents pressing Hageman about whether she adheres to the U.S. Constitution and whether she\u2019s concerned about alleged ICE and Trump administration violations of the 4th Amendment\u2019s protections against warrantless search and seizure.\n\nAudience members shouted references to a Department of Homeland Security internal memo that allegedly informed ICE agents they can enter homes without a judicial warrant.\n\n\u201cI think that I have to look at the investigation,\u201d Hageman responded, prompting a chorus of guffaws. \u201cIf there were violations of someone\u2019s constitutional rights, there is redress.\u201d\n\nThen why is there no redress?\u201d Taylor asked, and implored Hageman to demand transparency of investigations of the ICE killings. \n\n\u201cThey are killing American citizens in the streets, and you are doing nothing. You are not saying a single solitary thing to support constituents or to support the American people. As a constitutional lawyer, you should be infuriated. You should be incensed. Why are you not?\u201d\n\nHageman then gathered her folders, waved goodbye to the audience and exited the stage through a side door while people booed and one man shouted \u201ccoward\u201d and \u201cchickenshit.\u201d\n\nHageman, who recently announced her Senate bid to replace retiring Sen. Cynthia Lummis, began the town hall event by noting it was her 1st of the year, and that she intends to continue to make good on her promise to visit each of Wyoming\u2019s 23 counties annually.\n\nHer team allotted 1 hour for the town hall. \n\nHageman spent the 1st 30 minutes recapping her recent accomplishments in Congress.\n\nShe voted in favor of the continuing budget resolution while helping to secure about $3 million for the Casper/Natrona County International Airport, $1 million for a Northern Arapahoe water treatment facility and more than $1.6 million for reconstruction of the Fort Laramie canal tunnel, which collapsed more than 6 years ago.\n\nHageman also touted her work to advance the Grasslands Grazing Act, sexual predator legislation and anti-abortion measures. \n\nShe blamed recent winter-storm-related power outages in the eastern U.S. on Obama and Biden policies to steer electrical generation away from coal and toward renewable energy. \n\nHageman tied the inordinate volume of truck-driver-related deaths along Interstate 80 in Wyoming to immigrants who can\u2019t speak or read English and touted a measure to allow \u201c18 to 20-year-old\u201d truck drivers to legally cross state lines.\n\nExisting laws present \u201ca barrier,\u201d Hageman said, adding that her congressional work will make sure \u201cthat our 18 to 20-year-olds are getting the training and can have the career \u2014 that really fabulous career \u2014 as truck drivers.\u201d\n\nAmong the most common questions she\u2019s asked, Hageman said, before taking questions, is \u201cHow do we keep more of our young people in the state of Wyoming?\n\n\u201cThe key \u2026 is you have to have good jobs and you have to have housing \u2014 and housing prices across the country are astronomical.\u201d That\u2019s because of past policies that inhibit logging the nation\u2019s forests, Hageman said, leaving housing developers prone to skyrocketing lumber prices from other countries.\n\nIt\u2019s why, in the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill, \u201cWe\u2019re requiring the U.S. Forest Service to sell 250 million board-feet, and we\u2019re also requiring that they enter into 20-year lease contracts with our timber companies \u2014 so that these companies can invest in what they need to, but they know that they\u2019ll have those contracts in the long term.\u201d\n\nRising housing and rental costs have outpaced incomes while new construction lags \u2014 which some blame on overly burdensome permitting, according to a recent analysis by the Wyoming Community Development Authority. \n\nThe analysis also suggests that an aging population and youth out-migration are factors.\n\nAbout a dozen people were still in line to ask Hageman a question when she walked off the stage \u2014 about five minutes before the allotted time was up.\n\nIt\u2019s not the 1st time Hageman has seen criticism and discord at her town hall events",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter:\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of saline/water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: (Advice from a medic: You always will use a tourniquet first before trying to stop the bleeding with pressure. Stopping arterial bleeds with pressure is something that, if you actually want to be effective, have to literally dig inside their open wound and squeeze shut the severed artery. It\u2019s way faster to put a tourniquet on and it saves way more blood. Also unless you have a clot forming impregnated gauze for pressure, your success with pressure alone will be significantly less than a guaranteed proper tourniquet application on limbs. Once again tourniquets only go on your limbs.\nIf the bleeding is arterial (spurting, pulsating, bright red typically) then you throw the tourniquet on as high above the bleeding area and as tight as possible over clothes (EX: If it\u2019s the forearm that\u2019s bleeding, apply the tourniquet near the armpit). Ideally you remove loose or bulky clothing first though. For example, If a person has a jacket on, remove it as fast as possible and throw the tourniquet on. You should get the tourniquet on within 60 seconds. Online guides might tell you to tighten the windlass/rod till you can\u2019t put your fingers underneath the tourniquet but under twisting is a way worse issue than over twisting. If you\u2019ve already twisted a tourniquet as much it will go and they\u2019re still bleeding, throw on another one directly above and as close to the first tourniquet as possible. Do not put it over the first one and don\u2019t let there be a space between the two tourniquets that are larger than 1 centimeter. The more space, the worse for the healthy tissue in between the two tourniquets. For legs, often times you\u2019ll need to put on two tourniquets. Time of application should be written on their tourniquet, there\u2019s a spot on the Velcro strap you use as a second measure of securing the windlass/rod.\nIf you have to question what type of bleeding it is on a limb, just throw the damn Tourniquet on.\nWorks for two reasons:\n1.\t\u2060\u2060better safe than sorry\n2.\t\u2060\u2060the one with a TQ on, especially if it\u2019s on an arm and if they have that dog in them, can leave on their own to a place where medical care can reach them. Holding pressure will just take two protesters out of protesting.\nTourniquets can remain on you safely for 6-8 hours with minimal to no side effects. Some surgeons have fully restored function of limbs with TQs on for longer than 24 hours. They\u2019re a great tool and should be the first thing used for arterial limb/extremity bleeds.\nAlso, direct pressure HURTS WAY WORSE THAN A TOURNIQUET.\nTLDR: ALWAYS TOURNIQUET FIRST ON LIMBS THAT ARE BLEEDING LIKE CRAZY.\nSource: am medic. \n\n(Back to former firefighters advice: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Use plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nSide note: Direct pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with cloth, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter:\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of saline/water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: (Advice from a medic: You always will use a tourniquet first before trying to stop the bleeding with pressure. Stopping arterial bleeds with pressure is something that, if you actually want to be effective, have to literally dig inside their open wound and squeeze shut the severed artery. It\u2019s way faster to put a tourniquet on and it saves way more blood. Also unless you have a clot forming impregnated gauze for pressure, your success with pressure alone will be significantly less than a guaranteed proper tourniquet application on limbs. Once again tourniquets only go on your limbs.\nIf the bleeding is arterial (spurting, pulsating, bright red typically) then you throw the tourniquet on as high above the bleeding area and as tight as possible over clothes (EX: If it\u2019s the forearm that\u2019s bleeding, apply the tourniquet near the armpit). Ideally you remove loose or bulky clothing first though. For example, If a person has a jacket on, remove it as fast as possible and throw the tourniquet on. You should get the tourniquet on within 60 seconds. Online guides might tell you to tighten the windlass/rod till you can\u2019t put your fingers underneath the tourniquet but under twisting is a way worse issue than over twisting. If you\u2019ve already twisted a tourniquet as much it will go and they\u2019re still bleeding, throw on another one directly above and as close to the first tourniquet as possible. Do not put it over the first one and don\u2019t let there be a space between the two tourniquets that are larger than 1 centimeter. The more space, the worse for the healthy tissue in between the two tourniquets. For legs, often times you\u2019ll need to put on two tourniquets. Time of application should be written on their tourniquet, there\u2019s a spot on the Velcro strap you use as a second measure of securing the windlass/rod.\nIf you have to question what type of bleeding it is on a limb, just throw the damn Tourniquet on.\nWorks for two reasons:\n1.\t\u2060\u2060better safe than sorry\n2.\t\u2060\u2060the one with a TQ on, especially if it\u2019s on an arm and if they have that dog in them, can leave on their own to a place where medical care can reach them. Holding pressure will just take two protesters out of protesting.\nTourniquets can remain on you safely for 6-8 hours with minimal to no side effects. Some surgeons have fully restored function of limbs with TQs on for longer than 24 hours. They\u2019re a great tool and should be the first thing used for arterial limb/extremity bleeds.\nAlso, direct pressure HURTS WAY WORSE THAN A TOURNIQUET.\nTLDR: ALWAYS TOURNIQUET FIRST ON LIMBS THAT ARE BLEEDING LIKE CRAZY.\nSource: am medic. \n\n(Back to former firefighters advice: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Use plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nSide note: Direct pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with cloth, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

While they're busy trying to undermine progressives in their ranks like Jamaal Bowman and Zorhan Mandani, the Republicans are burning the country to the ground and folks are getting murdered by the state faster than we can keep track. So infuriating.",

        "body": "Are things very tense? Depends on where you live. The people of Minneapolis have been going through alot and it's reached a point where people don't feel safe leaving their homes, businesses have been impacted, and people are less likely to seek medical care. I live in Texas where ICE has been working more discreetly since the state government is more aligned with the Trump administration. That being said, there have been scary sightings in Texas. I would encourage you to check out iceout.org to look at the map of ICE sightings and you'll see the dramatic differences between Minneapolis and a red state like Indiana.\n\nAre they detaining US citizens? Yes. The Supreme Court has allowed the use of racial profiling by ICE. Anyone who isn't white or speaks with an accent is fair game for getting detained. I'm Mexican American and feel like I must carry my passport everywhere I go. I worry for my parents even though they are citizens since they speak with accents.\n\nAre they police? No. ICE is supposed to be exclusively immigration enforcement and have no business engaging or policing US citizens. In Minneapolis, Chicago, etc. we saw plenty of examples of ICE agents doing things outside of their scope. Unlike police they are not wearing uniforms, they cover their faces, and drive unmarked vehicles. They only receive 47 days of training whereas police academies are usually a minimum of 90 days. Many police officers and former military have commented on the poor handling of firearms, lack of understanding of rules of engagement, inappropriate use of force, lack of protocols for the victims vehicles, etc. \n\nCan we call the police on them? Yes. Given that they are not identifying themselves, changing their license plates daily, etc. It is impossible to know if they are legitimate ICE agents or human traffickers in disguise. In Houston there was an incident where supposed ICE agents attempted to break into a home. The home owners called 911 to inform them of the situation and that they would have to use their firearms in self defense. They shot the \"ICE agents\" dead and the local police stated they had no knowledge of ICE agents in the area. \n\nWhy aren't more of us fighting back with firearms? Not all of us carry firearms and laws vary from one state to the next. Additionally, if we use lethal force there is very little chance that we would survive. They are heavily armed and operate in groups. Also, if an ICE agent gets shot or killed it will give Trump reason to invoke the Insurrection Act and martial law.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter:\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of saline/water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: (Advice from a medic: You always will use a tourniquet first before trying to stop the bleeding with pressure. Stopping arterial bleeds with pressure is something that, if you actually want to be effective, have to literally dig inside their open wound and squeeze shut the severed artery. It\u2019s way faster to put a tourniquet on and it saves way more blood. Also unless you have a clot forming impregnated gauze for pressure, your success with pressure alone will be significantly less than a guaranteed proper tourniquet application on limbs. Once again tourniquets only go on your limbs.\nIf the bleeding is arterial (spurting, pulsating, bright red typically) then you throw the tourniquet on as high above the bleeding area and as tight as possible over clothes (EX: If it\u2019s the forearm that\u2019s bleeding, apply the tourniquet near the armpit). Ideally you remove loose or bulky clothing first though. For example, If a person has a jacket on, remove it as fast as possible and throw the tourniquet on. You should get the tourniquet on within 60 seconds. Online guides might tell you to tighten the windlass/rod till you can\u2019t put your fingers underneath the tourniquet but under twisting is a way worse issue than over twisting. If you\u2019ve already twisted a tourniquet as much it will go and they\u2019re still bleeding, throw on another one directly above and as close to the first tourniquet as possible. Do not put it over the first one and don\u2019t let there be a space between the two tourniquets that are larger than 1 centimeter. The more space, the worse for the healthy tissue in between the two tourniquets. For legs, often times you\u2019ll need to put on two tourniquets. Time of application should be written on their tourniquet, there\u2019s a spot on the Velcro strap you use as a second measure of securing the windlass/rod.\nIf you have to question what type of bleeding it is on a limb, just throw the damn Tourniquet on.\nWorks for two reasons:\n1.\t\u2060\u2060better safe than sorry\n2.\t\u2060\u2060the one with a TQ on, especially if it\u2019s on an arm and if they have that dog in them, can leave on their own to a place where medical care can reach them. Holding pressure will just take two protesters out of protesting.\nTourniquets can remain on you safely for 6-8 hours with minimal to no side effects. Some surgeons have fully restored function of limbs with TQs on for longer than 24 hours. They\u2019re a great tool and should be the first thing used for arterial limb/extremity bleeds.\nAlso, direct pressure HURTS WAY WORSE THAN A TOURNIQUET.\nTLDR: ALWAYS TOURNIQUET FIRST ON LIMBS THAT ARE BLEEDING LIKE CRAZY.\nSource: am medic. \n\n(Back to former firefighters advice: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Use plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nSide note: Direct pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with cloth, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

                    "body": "For example, if you get shot/ stabbed in your forearm, you\u2019re supposed throw a tourniquet on \u201chigh\u201d above it, closer to the heart around 3 inches above the wound and you need to cinch tail of the tourniquet after it\u2019s looped through the buckle. This needs to be secured really \u201ctight\u201d and snug to the skin/thin outer layer of clothing before you go ahead and twist the windlass/rod. \n\n\u201cHigh and tight\u201d is phrasing that helps you remember the, at bare minimum, required application to ensure there isn\u2019t bleeding. \n\nAlso, with gun shot wounds, there\u2019s an exit wound and typically that\u2019s the wound which bleeds the most. If you suspect a gunshot wound, you might as well put the tourniquet at the highest point on their limb as there\u2019s a chance the entrance wound might be higher than where you see the bleeding. \n\nDuring casualty assessments, medical providers do something called a blood sweep in which the check limbs and the neck for bleeds. They will literally squeeze and feel circumferentially every appendage to ensure there\u2019s no mass hemorrhaging (massive life threatening bleeding). Without training, you will not be able to do this correctly. \n\nThe \u201chigh and tight\u201d tourniquet application is what any non medical person should do when they see bleeding. Medical professionals in emergency med can make adjustments to the tourniquet, apply a new one, and do other things to save as much tissue as possible (often times almost all of it). \n\nYour worry should be stopping the bleed. If all you remember from everything I typed up was \u201cI will put a tourniquet on as high on a bleeding arm/ leg (near the core of a body) and will tightly loop the tail through the belt loop before twisting it\u201d, you will do exactly what\u2019s expected to best save the injured person\u2019s life. Arterial bleeds are no joke.\n\nOnce again: Tourniquets are for arms and legs, not the neck, not anything else. \n\nDirect pressure is for the neck/ armpits and crotch area if they are bleeding.\n\nDon\u2019t ever put direct pressure on wounds to the abdomen or chest- that can make things worse. Only neck, armpits, crotch and in the event you do not have a tourniquet, you can put direct pressure on bleeds in limbs.",

And I'm actually so tired of this argument because only 5% are violent offenders.\n\nLike pro-ICE people make it want sound like if you got a problem with it then you are defending pedophiles and violent offenders, which yeah very high Republicans like Kristi Noem always wants to talk about violent offenders to sort of scapegoat the violent ones with the non-violent ones.\n\nBut I saw a post on X claiming that an undocumented immigrant raped a child and ICE protesters help them escape, I plug that post into Grok and it gave me some context that pointed out the guy was actually caught in a traffic stop some days later and is now in ICE detention.\n\nThat's the stats I want to see.\n\nI also know Takedown with Chris Hansen they caught 3 undocumented immigrants trying to meet a minor. \n\nI don't have an issue with police in general or deportations, but definitely the way ICE is doing things now doesn't make the country look good and it makes a city look dangerous.\n\nI really want to know for a fact, how many ICE arrest are actual ICE operations and how many are just police catching someone on an unrelated crime?\n\nI do think most of these violent offenders do get caught by regular law enforcement, I know it won't make much of a difference to someone to know.

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

It was essentially a very crude and out of touch example of how they're trying to come up with new rules/policy around limitations on home ownership in order to address the corporate/hedge fund/Airbnb style companies that are just buying up entire subdivisions in order to drive up housing costs. \n\nHe was talking about how they're trying to determine what constitutes a \"mom and pop\" realtor essentially. And suggested to Maria that her parents in retirement \"might own 5 or 10 or 12 homes\", as if to suggest that was still in line with a small business or typical retirement plan.  It just shows how they live in a completely different reality.  That said, the overall sentiment of establishing a threshold or limit on how much real estate you can own is likely a good thing.",

ICE is just randomly capturing people (at least for the most part). just like the SA. \n\nalso, ICE just wants chaos and strike fear into everyone who apposes them. just like the SA. menawhile Gestapo didnt want much attention from the public. sure they wanted you to know that they exist but most of Gestapos business was secret\n\nThe Gestapo was a secret agency hunting actual enemies of the state. not just people they didnt like but folks who were actually fighting against the regime. Gestapo is much closer to the FBI or KGB. at least the way they oporated. there were no big fighting or masses who walked down the street.\n\nthe gestapo didnt had many workers. the entire angency had around 20k employees. it was all office work. collecting information, sending agents undercover. if they stormed an undercover resistance movement it wasnt even Gestapo doing the arresting, but the police.",

That's what ICE grunts masses in the streets are doing. AI says the gestapo was the official secret police of Nazi Germany, whose role was to identify, arrest, and persecute political opponents, Jews, and other minorities, using extreme brutality, torture, and \"protective custody\" (arbitrary detention without trial). Now, some of those our SA sends to detention endure whatever goes on when ice refuses to let congress do their constitutionally mandated oversight duties, feeds them spoiled food with maggots in it, denies them their medications, and refuses to let them see attorneys or have due process. Some have disappeared permanently.\n\nThe SS eventually subsumed both the SA and the gestapo. Bottom line, I see ICE as embodying both the SS and the gestapo.",

                            "body": "I'm going to hop into your argument a few days late. \n\nThe SA is absolutely the appropriate parallel. \n\nThe SA were recruited from members of the right-wing, unemployed men, and former criminals. They were known for being street bullies, were marginally trained, mainly as a street-fighting force, and unlike the SS they were not highly educated. They were Hitler's private army in the early days of Nazi Germany and were there to foster an environment of fear and intimidation. \n\nThe SS was initially a small unit within the SA under Himmler's leadership whose original purpose was to be a small elite personal bodyguard unit for Hitler. \n\nNight of the Long Knives was where Himmler orchestrated a purge of the SA to initially increase the influence and power of the SS, comparatively. The reason for the purge was (a) that the SA were a sloppy relatively untrained bunch of roving thugs and therefore had extremely bad optics, (b) some power struggles between Rohm (head of the SA) and Himmler, and (c) Hitler needed to get support from the Army and there was a lot of friction between the (disciplined, non-thuggish, trained) Army and the SA.\n\nThis is when the SA became a relatively minor force dropping in ranks from about 3 million to a little over 1 million members. They were still around, but heavily weakened and under the control of Viktor Lutze, not Himmler.\n\nIt also needs to be emphasized that the SS were highly trained, with a heck of a lot of lawyers in their ranks. In stark contrast to ICE, they had extensive leadership training and an emphasis on physical and mental fitness.\n\nThe Gestapo was initially a separate secret police which after Night of the Long Knives was put under Himmler's control. They did end up under Himmler's control. And these guys were highly trained as well. \n\nICE is anything but a secret police or comparable to the Gestapo. They get 47 days of training (because Trump is #47) while the Gestapo were an educated elite force trained in interrogation, persecution, and clandestine operations. ICE is anything but trained and couldn't clandestine their way out of a paper bag.",

The difference seems to be that I'm more focused on *behaviors*, and you're more focused on *training*. We agree that the ice thugs in the streets are exactly comparable to the SA. The only difference I see in our thinking is that I'm comparing ice's treatment of prisoners with the gestapo's brutality, torture, and detention without trial  (except the kind of torture is probably different), whereas your point is that ice overall has grossly inadequate training. I agree with you on that, too. I also have serious doubts about what the training consists of, and you probably do, too!",

Imo, the speed at which they're moving is because the plan called for him to win in 2020, so they're behind schedule now.

He's still trying to prove himself worthy of being the titular ruler of the world. Plus, of course, the guy with the big scythe is close behind him.\n\nIf nothing stops them, I think the warehouses they're buying up will be used as work camps, and the first prisoners will be the homeless, because back when he was bulldozing homeless camps in DC, he floated the idea of taking them somewhere \"far from here\" and taking care of them. They've already talked about the dignity of work, so forcing the homeless to do the jobs migrants did will likely be advertised as giving them dignity and self-respect, and paying them little or nothing will be because they're working off the cost of the government feeding, clothing, and sheltering them. His base will think that's a good \"common sense\" idea, because his writers know how to package any kind of bullshit as something tasty. They will eat it up. \n\nThe current detention centers have already practiced abusing the prisoners and giving them small portions of spoiled, maggoty food, and early on, excessive deaths will be blamed on poor health from living on the streets during the Biden administration. Later, they will privatize them, for \"efficiency\", and won't bother making excuses for deaths. All in all, I think the work camps will pretty closely match the Nazi forced labor camps.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better. Disclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

As ProPublica reported, a 6-year-old boy in Chicago was\u00a0detained with his mother in a large apartment raid\u00a0during \u201cOperation Midway Blitz.\u201d\n\n&gt;The Marshall Project spoke with three different lawyers representing children who were held with their families at Dilley. They said their clients were often taken into detention during in-person check-ins and had pending cases that could result in them remaining in the country legally. The lawyers believe their clients were detained not because of any danger they posed, but because the Trump administration is trying to deport as many people as possible.\n\n&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re probably the easiest catch for a lot of immigration officials,\u201d said Veronica Franco Salazar, a Houston-based immigration lawyer.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better. Disclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

Police unions are well organized. When a politician says anything negative about the police guess what happens. The officers, their wife, their kids, their parents and their grandparents will all vote against them. This is why you see police have such a hold on cities and states and why they won\u2019t get involved with ice. They want a fat paycheck with as little work as possible. \n\nSo hit them where it hurts. Vote any chiefs out, vote any council members who don\u2019t put pressure on them and them where it hurts. Cut their budgets and give that money to a new organization aimed at protecting citizens from ice.",

In Illinois it's called LOCAL GOVERNMENT (50 ILCS 725/) Uniform Peace Officers' Disciplinary Act.\n\nThis act provides law enforcement with additional rights that are not afforded to any other persons in the US, including the armed forces.  Law enforcement accused of misconduct have a host of rights like, only being interrogate during their duty hours, potty breaks during interrogation, and changing their statements after reading the statements from an accuser (to name a few).  \n\nAs a Veteran previously on active duty, we were subjected to UCMJ, local, state and international law with no conditions for \"double jeopardy\".  Meaning, you can be charged will all laws at once.  Aside from all the other bs we have to campaign for, abolishing the LEBOR's needs to be a top priority.\n\n*edit - grammar",

The post claims the video posted by Don Jr is AI generated, however [Alex's family and lawyers have confirmed that this is indeed him in the video](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-alex-pretti-scuffle-federal-agents-minneapolis-11-days-before-his-death/). I don't usually make posts like this but I feel it is important to not allow the narrative to be muddied by false accusations of AI and the framing of the right wing. [Whether Alex kicked out the tail light of a rental car](https://youtu.be/CRWR13BAIEs?si=znJmyfshkFAxdRw4) has no bearing on whether or not he deserved to be executed in the streets 11 days later, for those who are still confused, it does not.

[The 2nd angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2TRbFmutrw) was posted 13 days ago, 8 days *before* the shooting.\n\nIt's 1000% not AI.\n\nI'll always mention though that this does not change the fact Alex Pretti was executed in the streets for protecting two women from being assaulted. If anything, it proves he wasn't going to pull his gun, and agents pinning him down in almost an identical situation did not fear for their lives.\n\n[Link to his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealOrAI/comments/1qqb9f3/comment/o2femtc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nAnd other Comment :\n\n\n\n[z64\\_dan ](https://www.reddit.com/user/z64_dan/)\n\nIt's not AI. Believe it or not, he was protesting for multiple days.\n\nLike I said in another thread, breaking a tail light is not grounds for execution.\n\nAnd this also goes to show he wasn't trying to bring his gun to shoot people, because he had the chance 11 days beforehand to shoot people (and 10 days before, and 9 days before, etc).\n\n[Link to his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealOrAI/comments/1qqb9f3/comment/o2fgshl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of saline/water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

A third in El Paso, Texas, could be among the largest jails of any kind in the country if completed as envisioned, with 8,500 beds. The deals mark the latest turn in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s plan to use as many as 23 warehouses for detaining thousands of immigrants arrested by federal agents in Minneapolis and other cities. Those aggressive enforcement actions have ignited clashes with protesters and led to agents killing two US citizens.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the administration paid $102 million for a site near Hagerstown, Maryland, according to a local court filing. A week later, the government paid $70 million in cash for a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona. The price tags \u2014 roughly in line with the industry average for the warehouse market \u2014 cover just the acquisition of the sites, which are currently empty shells. ICE still has to pay companies to outfit the buildings with toilets, showers, beds, dining and recreation areas and then run them as detention centers.\n\n[Read the full story here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/us-spends-hundreds-of-millions-on-warehouses-for-ice-detention-centers)",

      "author": "KarmaPotatoes",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "Just read a post from another Reddit user that was written about 4 hours ago in a different sub. They were accosted by ICE in a Target parking lot because they \u201clooked foreign\u201d. They were hit with rapid fire questions about where they were from, how long they have been here and where they work, etc. They were actually asked to show their ID and any proof of being citizens.  It is just one of many infuriating examples all over Reddit where people felt intimidated and unsafe specifically because they were targeted based on appearance, taken aside, questioned and asked for ID (including their entire personal background and history) by uneducated, untrained and unethical ICE workers who appear to be making up their own rules as they go. Fully endorsed by everyone no matter what, with no accountability to anyone\u2014especially not the U.S. government. These events keep happening in and around schools, in workplaces, while shopping and while people just go about their normal day. This example is one of many being reported occurring at Target parking lots, where ICE has historically waited for people to enter or exit the store. Does this sound like targeted racism? It\u2019s because that\u2019s what it is.\n\nA few things:\n\n1. No accountability, consequences for wrongdoing or even acknowledgement of law breaking  on the part of ICE or the government who employs them (i.e., murdering innocent, average people on the street and then covering that up) means that more of the same will keep happening and happening and happening. If a government keeps lying to you and you keep believing them just because they are the ones in charge and tell you otherwise, just expect them to take full advantage of that. They will keep lying, because it\u2019s effective.\n2. As a country (U.S.), we would do well to consider character and capacity for compassion including a high ethical standard before we elect people into any office, whatsoever. Elect a complete delusional narcissist who doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself and has never had to struggle in his entire life due to privilege, money, corruption and the manipulation of others\u2026.maybe don\u2019t expect anything good to come of that. ICE agents are similarly a different personality profile, entirely. They are insecure bullies who enjoy intimidating. They are already hyper focused on power, control and putting people in their place to feel better about themselves.  As people go out to protest and make their voices heard, please remember this is not like dealing with reasonable people, anymore. Be brave but exercise caution. ICE is its own beast; they are not thinking like you and aren\u2019t required to value your life. \n3. I think our only way out of this is to keep verbalizing our disdain and disgust, communicating with elected leaders and asking what they are doing (not just saying) to change the narrative, to keep protecting our neighbors and\u2014for sure\u2014voting in the midterm election and the next presidential election in a manner that will completely change this country\u2019s present course. Maybe consider new leaders who possess high ethics and high compassion?\n\nPlease be safe out there. Standing with you all!",

For a franchise that so many grew up loving, the meaning behind it feels oddly forgotten.\n\nAt its heart, Star Wars was never just about space battles or aesthetics. It was a story about the struggle between authoritarian power and collective resistance, about how fear and unchecked control lead to violence, and how hope, empathy, and ordinary people standing together can push back against that. That\u2019s why it resonated with millions of people around the world for generations.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a reminder. Stories like Star Wars endure because they reflect real human struggles and real moral choices. Remembering what it actually stood for might be worth revisiting, especially in times when those themes feel less fictional than they once did.",

If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them.

Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

        "body": "At first glance, the scuffle in [the video](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1203571754778908) seems shocking. A New York City school principal, waving a bat, stops masked [ICE agents](https://www.wired.com/tag/immigration-customs-enforcement/) from trying to enter the building, and instead of violence, the encounter erupts with cheers from onlookers. \u201cLet me show you why they call me bat girl,\u201d she says to them. In [other clips](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT30oqrDgpV/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D) like it, a server flings a bowl of hot noodles at two officers dining at a Chinese restaurant, and a [shop owner](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSR-ouxDaLx/?igsh=MXhuczM1MGZ5MXdxYQ%3D%3D) flexes her Fourth Amendment rights. None of the encounters end in bloodshed.\n\nThe videos, equal parts tense and bombastic, are also clearly AI-generated. They are part of a constellation of anti-ICE AI content that is spreading across social media as the federal occupation of Minneapolis\u2014part of the Trump administration\u2019s attack on immigrants\u2014has resulted in agents killing two US citizens in January. Both [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.wired.com/story/the-campaign-to-destroy-renee-good/), a 37-year-old mother of three, and [Alex Pretti](https://www.wired.com/story/the-instant-smear-campaign-against-border-patrol-shooting-victim-alex-pretti/), a 37-year-old US Department of Veterans Affairs ICU nurse, were unarmed when they were fatally shot by government officials.\n\nIn America, [the role of fantasy](https://www.wired.com/story/protest-unrest-role-of-fantasy/)\u2014the act of imagining a better world and putting action behind it to make it true\u2014is paramount during times of political unrest. The videos, which have millions of views on Facebook and Instagram, offer a blend of revisionist justice that imagines a digital multiverse where the ICE agents are just like us: not above the rule of law.\n\nIn the aggregate, anti-ICE AI videos are a way for people to push against the [distortions](https://www.wired.com/story/the-instant-smear-campaign-against-border-patrol-shooting-victim-alex-pretti/) painted by the Trump administration and MAGA influencers to justify their actions, says AI creator Nicholas Arter. \u201cOver the last decade, social media served that role by giving a voice to people who lacked access to traditional media. It\u2019s not surprising that with AI, another major technological shift, we\u2019re seeing similar patterns repeat, with people using the tools available to articulate emotions, fears, or resistance.\u201d But while they might feel cathartic, the videos themselves are also a type of distortion. That can have consequences, whether bolstering the narrative that people of color are agitators, or making the public more skeptical of actual video evidence.\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/anti-ice-videos-are-getting-the-ai-fanfic-treatment-online/](https://www.wired.com/story/anti-ice-videos-are-getting-the-ai-fanfic-treatment-online/)",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

Thankfully we are not at a high volume of ICE sightings in MA **\\*yet\\***, but when reported to LUCE, they are able to get eyes on the situation very quickly to confirm and warn the community of ICE presence.\n\nIf your State or community has an organization, please share it!\n\nUnfortunately the MA subreddit doesn't even allow ICE posts anymore and get auto-modded due to a megathread; not sure if other States' subs are doing this too.\n\nThis is a great subreddit to continue spreading the word of different organizations and resources.",

Places that have had a defense against ICE that\u2019s been effective have displayed more hyperlocal response. I live in LA and following June last year we had that happen where a bunch of groups, sometimes from completely different counties, pushed the call us idea and LA/SoCal have been consistently getting wrecked by ICE because when that shift happened it just became slow and honestly not very effective. Places where ICE hasn\u2019t established a foothold should really focus on training and pushing for neighborhoods and their adjacent neighborhoods to do rapid response. Especially with it being winter time and I heard the NE is getting ready to have a snow storm. That\u2019s just my two cents from someone that\u2019s been otg in Los Angeles the past year.",

      "author": "Limp_Bike_9145",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "I know someone who lives in Portland, and she's very dear to me. I haven't heard from her in over 12 hours, which I'm hoping is just a coincidence. I've called her, and it's straight to voicemail. She had told me that her trans friend was being stalked by an ICE agent a few days ago, so I'm just hoping she's okay. I just want to get the word out there.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m protecting her identity by not mentioning her name. I am trying to be as patient as possible waiting for a response from her. I\u2019ll update this if I do hear from her at all.\n\nUpdate: I still haven\u2019t heard from her, but I have done a wellness check. The sheriff was not able to get ahold of her, but her roommate says my friend left for work at 7. He had to call the roommate because she didn\u2019t answer the door. Was mistrusting of law enforcement, so the roommate didn\u2019t say much. I believe her roommate is trans (or at least LGBTQ aligned) as well. Still weird. She works R&amp;D at a company, and they have a clean room she can\u2019t have her phone in. I\u2019ve known this, but to not hear from her for this long still seems strange. As far as ICE goes, still not sure if it\u2019s something to worry about. All I know is her friend was being stalked, and now I\u2019m not hearing from her.\n\nAs I said in a comment, I have reached out to one local newspaper there. They only do emails for news suggestions. Hopefully they can do some type of investigating for the trans community there. I will contact more when I have the time. Just trying to find something out right now.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: Okay!!! She is fine. I\u2019m so glad, but after what she told me the other day, I just thought the worst. I\u2019m gonna try to get her to talk to someone about what happened to her friend, anonymously. She might be willing to get the word out. UGH! After causing all of this commotion, I\u2019m embarrassed. Much more relieved than embarrassed though. At least there\u2019s that. Either way, someone stalked her friend, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not the only one. The problem with things like this is it\u2019s hard for people to speak out until there\u2019s a need to. Anyway, I\u2019ll see if her or her friend will. If something like this happens to you, speak out because you have friends and family members who love you. We need to know.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

Get out of the area if possible once sprayed; you\u2019re no help to anyone in that condition.  Water and lots of it, directly on your eyes, as soon as possible, and then face into the wind and let it dry.  It\u2019ll stop hurting when it\u2019s dry.  Keep blinking even just a bit, otherwise it\u2019ll glue your eyes shut.\n\nLater, when you are in a safe location, wash your face following these mandatory rules:  \n\u2022 Bend over the water source, don\u2019t face into it standing.  Think about where the runoff will go\u2014don\u2019t fry your sensitive areas!  \n\u2022 Plan to take as long as needed to wash it off slowly.  I took three hours myself.  \n\u2022 Start by putting a small amount of baby shampoo on your fingers and just _patting_ your face, not rubbing.  \n\u2022 Rinse gently with cold water.\n\u2022 Every time you repeat this process, and it will be many, turn up the temperature a tiny bit and start slowly rubbing gentle circles on your cheeks and forehead, expanding the areas each time.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t forget your ears and neck!  (And any other skin that got exposed.)\n\nDo note that oil-based sprays stick and linger longer, putting you at more risk of a reaction.  Water-based are recommended for training, as they rinse off more easily; I think we can safely assume they\u2019ll be using oil-based.  There is a small but very real risk of an allergic reaction leading to progressive permanent blindness, this happened to a friend of mine during training.  This is why pain reduction _always_ comes secondary to thorough eye rinsing.\n\nBe safe out there folks.",

        "body": "FOR THE COUNTRY\n\nREPOST THIS! It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of water to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed. (A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

There are no websites or apps that I know of.  Most of them are easily infiltrated by Feds and can be bad actors. I would 100% avoid them.  I would seek assistance from neighborhood or immigration groups near you that may have started or have been preparing for increase in ICE activity. Most started by neighbor talking to neighbor, friends talking to friends and building an organic network on encrypted apps.  They may be also have trainings and connections.  I have no idea where you are.  I am in Minneapolis.  We use a very well sourced website to check plates. Works better on phone and not on desktop.  [www.defrostmn.net](http://www.defrostmn.net)\n\nIt will tell you Confirmed Vehicles, Not in database, Or cleared (often when ICE uses a rental for a while, returns it and it gets rented to regular Jane and Joe who have no idea is was used in actions and people get followed , etc  OR they just happen to own a vehicle that is often used by ICE -Ford Explorer, Dodge Durango, Caravans,Ford F150s with heavy tint, etc)  If you are from vulnerable group or very risk averse it is understandable to avoid ICE encounters.  But my hope is that you step into the discomfort and show up at ICE actions to observe, video from a safe distance, or whistle or be loud.  Most ICE actions are over in less than 10 minutes. Again larger raids are now extremely rare.\n\nHopefully there is a phone number you can call when you see federal agents out in full tactical gear. Ours were set up by local immigrant groups.

They already do. Will they brutalize anyone opposing them? They already do. Will they kill us? They already do.\n\nThey are going to declare insurrection whenever it most suits their needs, and it will be based exclusively on that. They will fabricate whatever lies they want to justify it.\n\nThe only thing we need to do is to prepare a response for when, not *if*, they declare insurrection. Until then, we should continue protesting in the most effective ways possible.",

Negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including customer boycotts, loss of customers, loss of development opportunities or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. A decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our communities or corporate image could negatively affect its market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIncreased public resistance, including negative media attention and public opinion, to the use of private companies for the management and operation of facilities supporting immigration, may negatively impact our brand and the public perception of the Company. Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend largely on our ability to differentiate ourselves from the direct participants in the ongoing conflict around immigration policy. If we are portrayed negatively in the press or associated with the ongoing social and political debates around immigration policy, our public image and reputation could be irreparably tarnished, and our brand could be harmed. If we are unable to counter such negative media attention effectively, investors may lose confidence in our business, which could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\u201d\n\n**TLDR: Target Hospitality is concerned about the general public knowing that they are the ones providing rancid food to detainees in Dilley, TX. It seems important that people know they, specifically, are the company providing rancid food to detainees in Dilley.**",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. (A message from a helpful fellow: An increasing amount of metro/state/federal radio is now encrypted, which is impossible to receive on a scanner.  More than just a semantic detail here:  Just because you don't hear it on a scanner doesn't mean it's not coming at you. If it works, great, but don't rely on it. If you have the opportunity, you can find out who in your area is running dark by checking RadioReference (then again, if you own a $500+ scanner that does P25 Phase 2, you probably already do this).\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them.

(A message from another helpful fellow: Just to add, if you\u2019re purchasing or carrying tourniquets, PLEASE learn how to use them correctly - including how quickly tissue death can happen. Whilst they can save a life in a trauma situation, if you use it incorrectly or in the wrong situation, it can unnecessarily cost someone their arm/leg. Additionally, if it\u2019s needed but you don\u2019t use it correctly, it might not be effective. If it\u2019s a cheap Temu one, it could also break during application - eg. in Ukraine, they use the cheap ones for training purposes only, as they often snap and aren\u2019t reliable enough to use for life-threatening situations.\n\nUse plain (ideally boiled, then cooled) water or saline solution to rinse eyes and wounds. Saline is used for eye baths, to rinse and help the eye surface return to neutral pH. Don\u2019t use anything even slightly acidic, such as milk, or anything that could lead to infection.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy saline pods, which can be purchased online or potentially from a pharmacy - boil some water, allow it to cool and fill clean bottle(s) with it. It won\u2019t be perfectly sterile due to the container, but it\u2019s better than just normal water which could contain bacteria. If you\u2019re able to sterilise the container before filling, even better.\nDisclaimer: not a doctor.)\n\nA note from another helpful fellow: (Hi friend, I think you should also be aware that PARSLEY is an incredibly dangerous plant, and if blended, and condensed in a process similar to making a tincture, can actually create a paste, powder, spray, etc. from a chemical that\u2019s UV-activated and causes severe burns! Be very careful NOT to accidentally get any of that on yourself, that would be terrible.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a good seasonal reminder not to leave oil-soaked rags anywhere in any sort of heap, as the evaporation of the material creates heat that can cause spontaneous combustion within as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s winter time and many folks are DIYing things, fixing up cars, making home-cooked meals, can\u2019t be too careful!)\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse.

      "text": "Sharing from rooey.wav:  Hey, gentle friends, ICE is now deploying LRAD on peaceful protestors. Here is a bit about what it is and how to protect yourself.\n\nAs always, this is for harm reduction purposes. My hope is that you use knowledge as power and keep the power with the people. \n\nLRAD = Long Range Acoustic Device \n\nThese are directional loudspeakers that project extremely loud sound over a long distance for communication or crowd control. They CAN cause permanent damage if you're not careful. Tinnitus, balance issues, vertigo, &amp; hearing loss are all possible. Once the hair cells in your inner ear are destroyed, they don't ever regenerate.\n\nHow do you protect yourself? \n\nStep 1: Hearing protection is your first defense. I'm not talking about the kind you just found in your pocket; I'm talking industrial-grade, if possible. In-ear and over-ear combined can be highly effective. Noise-cancelling headphones are basically useless here; they're not magic shields but can help some. As a last resort, fingers in your ears just to get to safety works.\n\nStep 2: is distance. LRAD is directional; standing directly in the beam will hurt you quickly. MOVE, which is what they want you to do. Remember that the goal is to continue showing up and resisting. Do not downplay the idea of retreating and regrouping.\n\nStep 3: Barriers. Hard, dense objects block sounds best. A shield (piece of plywood, book, backpack, etc.) helps a little. But just know that sound is not a normal projectile; you're not going to be able to block it like you do rocks and rubber bullets. The sound will wrap around the device and get to you. However, a shield can and will reduce intensity. If you deploy a shield, use it to protect your head and ears first.\n\nStep 4: (This is implied but important) Don't stand in the beam. Angles really matter here, so just pay attention to them. Remember, lateral movement (side to side) is a good option that situations like these tend to trick you into thinking doesn't exist.\n\nStep 5: Limit time. Hearing loss happens with exposure duration and they stack FAST. Shorter is always better. Remember we want to be able to hear music and laughter and poetry readings and birds and dogs barking... protect your ears. Your body is capable of a lot of really great things but LRAD doesn't care and the ancient wisdom of retreat is sometimes the most advanced technology available.\n\nTL;DR: LRAD is a directional sound device that can injure hearing, and the only reliable ways to reduce harm are protect your ears, increase distance, use solid barriers, avoid the beam, and minimize time exposed.\n\nShare this information with someone you love who needs it.",

I didn't like how it came out so I scrapped it.\n\nBut in that picture, I had to decide whether or not people on a cold street would be wearing earmuffs or a hat. And I said to myself, 'no one's going to be wearing earmuffs, I think, because hearing as much as possible is the most important thing'.\n\nAnd now this from these motherless fucks.",

        "body": "**General Defense Protest Sign Instructions**:\n\n1. Glue a sheet of aluminum foil to the back of two pieces of thick posterboard or foam board. \n2. Sandwich your handle between the aluminum foil sides. \n3. Tape, staple, or glue it all together!\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- Make it big enough to crouch behind while walking if you can. If not, big enough to cover your head to your heart.\n\n- flat handles work best but a broom handle is fine too. A small air gap is fine and may even be marginally better. But make sure it's comfortable to hold and move with, consider wrapping flat boards with cloth or leather to make a handle.\n\n- I've heard thicker aluminum sheeting suggested instead of foil, this is untested but sounds better. Just avoid making something that could be described as a weapon please.\n\n- For acoustic defense specifically: \n  - These wavelengths are microscopic compared to sound waves you usually hear which can measure in feet, so acoustic foam, etc does nothing.\n  - Strong but flexible plastics like Lexan are extremely effective, with matte surfaces working better than glossy. Your intuition should be absorbing and scattering, not reflecting, the sound. A slab of unpolished marble, not a mirror. \n  - Concave surfaces direct more sound back towards the source. Potentially endangering the LRAD operator or bystanders. Do be careful.\n  - Still use good ear protection. It's hard to put into words how powerful the acoustic pressure is. This is not a reliable way to protect your ears. \n\n**Why**\n- Aluminum foil protects very effectively against the other kind of LRAD (\"Area Denial\" instead of \"Acoustic Device\") that uses microwaves. Two sheets will cover most tiny holes that you get in the foil. \n- Poster board alone has been shown to be effective against acoustic devices at \"warning\" decibel levels. \n- It's your goddamn right as an American.\n\n^(**DISCLAIMER**: Not AI I just wanted to make it look nice.

      "text": "ICE runs its end of month operations on the last tuesday of every month (in Eugene), meaning DHS security is always hyper aggressive that day. Yesterday was also the vigil for Alex Pretti, planned at the same federal building. This led to ICE/DHS leading numerous attacks against protesters both on and off federal property throughout the day.  \nThis video is missing at least two arrests made around noon, an assault reportedly repelled by an old woman with pepper spray, and the end of the night when they cleared the blocks with flash bang and tear gas grenades.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

Those people are tied up in lawsuits so they can\u2019t speak as freely, but I can think of one who has spoken up quite a bit. \n\nHe was detained outside of a factory while on his way to work. He pulled in, saw the commotion, tried to turn around but they smashed his window, yanked him out, roughed him up then took him to detention where he was held in solitary confinement for several days. Wasn\u2019t allowed a phone call. Never charged. He\u2019s a veteran with PTSD and they wouldn\u2019t provide care. Just locked him away for a few days. This was over the summer. \n\nOther non-Americans spoke up. One was a German guy crossing back into the U.S. from Mexico I believe. He was with his American wife. A few tourists who were detained for weeks for no reason spoke up early on. One was from wales. One from NZ I believe. It\u2019s hard to remember the details. Feels like another lifetime.

BLUF, or \u201cbottom line up front,\u201d is a military term that\u2019s [also used internally](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/) by some Palantir employees.\n\nDHS says that the software is \u201cbeing actively authorized\u201d in support of ICE operations, adding that the tool helps reduce the \u201ctime-consuming manual effort required to review and categorize incoming tips.\u201d The date when the AI-enhanced tip processing \u201cbecame operational\u201d is listed in the inventory as May 2, 2025.\n\nThe DHS inventory does not provide many details about the large language models Palantir uses to generate the BLUFs; however, it does note that ICE uses \u201ccommercially available large language models\u201d that were \u201ctrained on the public domain data by their providers.\u201d\n\n\"There was no additional training using agency data on top of what is available in the models\u2019 base set of capabilities,\u201d the inventory also notes. \u201cDuring operation, the AI models interact with tip submissions.\"\n\nThe \u201c2025 DHS AI Use Case Inventory,\u201d [published Wednesday](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/ai-use-case-inventory-library) on DHS\u2019s website, has been published for every year since 2022. The 2024 version of the inventory does not mention using AI to process tip line submissions.\n\nPalantir has been a major ICE contractor since 2011, and it provides a sweeping set of analytical tools for the agency. Until now, however, almost nothing has been known about Palantir\u2019s work processing tips for ICE.\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-using-palantirs-ai-tools-to-sort-through-tips/](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-using-palantirs-ai-tools-to-sort-through-tips/)",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

        "body": "On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security published new details about Mobile Fortify, the facial recognition app that federal immigration agents use as a method to identify people in the field, undocumented immigrants and United States citizens alike. The details, including the company behind the app, were published as part of DHS\u2019s [2025 AI Use Case Inventory](http://www.dhs.gov/publication/ai-use-case-inventory-library), which federal agencies are required to release periodically.\n\nThe inventory includes two entries for Mobile Fortify\u2014one for Customs and Border Protection, another for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2014and says the app is in the \u201cdeployment\u201d stage for both. CBP says that Mobile Fortify became \u201coperational\u201d at the beginning of May last year, while ICE got access to it on May 20, 2025. That date is about a month before 404 Media first [reported](https://www.404media.co/ice-is-using-a-new-facial-recognition-app-to-identify-people-leaked-emails-show/) on the app\u2019s existence.\n\nThe inventory also identified the app\u2019s vendor as NEC, which had previously been unknown publicly. On its website, NEC [advertises](https://www.necam.com/en_US/biometrics/reveal/index.html) a facial recognition solution called Reveal, which it says can do one-to-many searches or one-to-one matches against databases of any size. CBP says the app\u2019s vendor is NEC while ICE notes it was developed partially in house. A $23.9 million [contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSA20C00000006_7001_-NONE-_-NONE-) held between NEC and the DHS from 2020 to 2023 states that DHS was using NEC biometric matching products for \u201cunlimited facial quantities, on unlimited hardware platforms, and at unlimited locations.\u201d NEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth CBP and ICE say that the app is supposed to help quickly confirm people\u2019s identity, and ICE further says that it helps do so in the field \u201cwhen officers and agents must work with limited information and access multiple disparate systems.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-fortify-face-recognition-nec-ice-cbp/](https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-fortify-face-recognition-nec-ice-cbp/)\u00a0",

      "text": "From all the footage I've seen, things immediately jump to worst case scenario the moment they get hands on you. There was a video of a worker in a vehicle being questioned by ICE and he said \"go ahead, take me to jail.\" You\u00a0***do not***\u00a0want to be detained by ICE.\n\nThere is no due process. There are no Miranda rights being read. You don't get access to a phone call for an attorney. You won't get bailed out. They don't check your documentation. You will be dragged, assaulted, abused, and thrown into a \"detention center\" with hardly any basic necessities.\n\nWhatever you do, don't get grabbed. The moment you put hands on them, or let them nab you, you get swarmed by several or more \"agents\" and it's game over from there.\n\nNumerous reports of detainees being \"lost\" or having no paper trail of where they end up.\n\nBe safe out there when protesting, and keep your distance from these masked murderers. Protest to the leaders and to get the attention of lawmakers and the American people, not to provoke the overcompensating LARPers. They are itching for a reason to pull the trigger. Fuck ICE.",

Nick Sherly is here a grown man with an elderly man and some masked bodyguards that were seen behind him. He's going up to these daycare facility and asking to see the kids.\n\nI think even a real daycare facility would put the priority in protecting children.\n\nAlso, there was one case from Reddit where Reddit ended up harassing an actual daycare facility cause they thought no one was going in. It was a real daycare facility. I don't know too much about that. I just saw a YouTuber talk about it before.\n\nI'm not totally saying there's not fraud, but Nick Sherly investigation proved not much. I am still trying to learn up on this claim of fraud. But I do think it's creepy for a bunch of grown men, including mask men to show up to a daycare and ask to see kids. Could just seem like someone with bad intentions, and that's part of the point.",

I am that person. I'm looking for people who have had actual interactions with them. Have you been let go after showing proof of citizenship? This question is assuming there has been no hackling or any type of escalation towards the ICE officer. I cannot afford to do that. I need to go home at the end of the day, and I want my wife to be home too.\n\nI'm a citizen and US veteran, but I'm also a POC, as is my wife. ICE has come into our city, and there have been sightings within a few miles of us. We have eyes and a brain. We know ICE profiles people and has taken (and even killed) Americans unjustly many times before, but I also know most of those cases got to those points because there was escalation instead of de-escalation (not at all justifying the outcomes, though, they are cruel acts against humans). I want to know what my chances are if I play all my cards right and increase our chances of coming home at the end of the day.",

It is unbelievable.   \n\nI am a moderate, but very against the current ICE tactics and the way members of the administration have been stirring up anger and lying in press conferences. And of course, very saddened and disturbed by these killings. \n\nBut I have always been able to talk to people from both sides. These people who refuse to be even a little informed and avoid all news (when they used to watch the news every day) get me very aggravated. I can't even discuss major events with them. I can't have a discussion about root causes of problems, or the history of a problem (for example, Venezuela), or what may be happening as far as leadership at ICE (what the agents are told everyday) or why they aren't doing targeted arrests of people with outstanding deportation orders, rather than this \"sweep\" approach, where they want to knock on everyone's door, as the woman in this video is addressing.\n\nSure, the news is often disturbing. Sure, it can make us angry. But this has always been the case. During the civil rights era, during the Vietnam War, during Watergate, during the Gulf Wars - it has always been upsetting, but people need to know what is going on.   \n\nAnd as an aside I think people need to teach their kids, starting around age 5, about what is happening in the world, to give them a rough idea of what is going on - who the President is, why people are being deported, why people are angry about how things have been carried out in Minnesota, etc.   \n\nThese people who refuse to watch the news - do they think their grandparents did that during World War II?  People need to be informed, because it does affect our lives to some extent. Why do they want to crawl in a hole and live a fantasy life?  It's understandable if it's temporary if some event has severely affected family or friends, and they are traumatized. But otherwise, people need to be informed. In the last 15 years, I have sometimes met adults who are of normal intelligence who do not know or even recognize the name of the Vice President, as well as similar major facts about the country and what is going on. It is bizarre. People who don't know what Congress is. People who don't know that Hawaii is a state because it is so far away. When I was in 2nd grade, you would be laughed at if you didn't know the name of the VP.",

When you live and work with these people, and live under their laws and government, something becomes hauntingly clear.   \n  \nWhich is, their state government takes advantage of them in every possible situation. WE all know how that plays out with minorities down there, but they don\u2019t stop there. Every piece of law is tilted to benefit the elite and ruthlessly cuts down the average person. Most are ignorant or kept as such and that ensures the elite have a good chunk locked in. The smarter or true Christian\u2019s among them have a weakened spirit you can feel; they know what they live under and have long resigned themselves to quietly tolerate it. \n\nIt is very much a \u201cgood ole boy\u201d club and upward mobility is exclusively manicured via that nebulous evil system. People down there with even a crumb of power are also deeply manipulative, nothing ever feels organic and every conversation feels like a calculated dance. \n\nIt is like Kings Landing from Game of Thrones down there, and I\u2019m not even kidding. If you want to achieve down there, and you come from nothing and want to build something, you have better odds elswhere.",

      "text": "According to a CNN report published Tuesday, Pretti was involved in a confrontation with federal agents about a week before his murder. \u201cThe earlier incident started,\u201d CNN reported, \u201cwhen he stopped his car after observing ICE agents chasing what he described as a family on foot, and began shouting and blowing his whistle, according to a source who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution.\u201d\n\nCNN added that Pretti told the source \u201cthat five agents tackled him and one leaned on his back\u2014an encounter that left him with a broken rib. The agents quickly released him at the scene. \u2018That day, he thought he was going to die,\u2019 said the source.\u201d The source added that Pretti was \u201cknown to federal agents,\u201d according to CNN.\u00a0\n\nThis revelation that ICE and CBP agents identified Pretti as an opponent sheds new light on what actually happened on January 24. The video shows Pretti intervening to protect a woman, who had been shoved to the ground. He is then tackled and beaten, face down on the ground. One agent removes a legally carried gun he had in his possession but was not holding. Another agent, who was not involved in the initial assault on Pretti, then pushed this agent away and fired four shots in Pretti\u2019s back, as Pretti\u2019s arms were pinned to the ground. That agent and a second agent then fired six additional shots into Pretti\u2019s motionless body.\u00a0",

Alex was standing in the street so that the ICE data flagged him as a previous \u201cagitator\u201d  his role in the previous altercations was known to these idiot violent thugs. The women were people Alex would have intervened to help, so the thugs had a win-win situation. They get to beat up women, a special treat, and beat the holy shit out of Alex perhaps a kill. When the gun was found there was an excuse for the next kill. The team\u2019s objective was to start a riot. Not all knew that but those not told directly could follow along and figure it out.\n\nWhen Pretti came to the woman\u2019s assistance all the pieces came together. An opportunity to start the riot Trump so desperately needs, a man who likely had a gun because by then his identity was known as well his permit, so they were going to plummet him to within an inch of this life if they couldn\u2019t find the gun. But they know what a gun under clothing looks like so they believed it would be another plausible \u201cclean kill\u201d like Renee Good. The swarm was to hide what Alex did with his gun from the ever prying cameras, but it wasn\u2019t effective.\n\nMaybe a coincidence, but they probably were not particularly aiming for Alex specifically. If they found another person to execute with an excuse, that person would be just as dead",

But they know what a gun under clothing looks like so they believed it would be another plausible \u201cclean kill\u201d like Renee Good.\n\nHe had a gun on him in the footage of his earlier altercation. Multiple ice agents had him bent over with his gun sticking out from his belt, they still let him go initially, no questions asked, which I find extremely weird... They knew he would be armed, especially if it was the same agents. Even if it wasn\u2019t the same agents, they have a database of protestors. \n\nThe big question is why did ICE react so differently to him having a gun on him in this altercation compared to the previous one? Why did they act surprised? \n\nIf the same agents were involved in both the previous altercation and the murder, it would be very reasonable to suspect that this was a retaliatory killing. Pretty convenient that ice hide their identities right?",

He has an extremely long track record of funding for causes, never delivering, and disappearing with the money.\n\nI bring this up not to discredit the story itself (take that part seriously!

It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glues like Dermabond can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

We do need to keep that going. Growing the numbers is effective at raising attention and call to action.\n\nIn compliment, we need to raise our own local orgs and delegates to serve locally sourced district government.\n\n Specifically a new branch of government watchdogs called ombudsmen (ombudsmus system) and a strictly locally sourced enforcement system.\n\nWhy?\n Because we have to not only engage the civic agency we currently do have but we always need to raise the civic agency we don't have. If you aren't aware we are also fighting Institutional Capture, centralized power, and incompetently married executive and law enforcement branches.\n\nSo not only do we need to use what we have we need to build what we currently don't have. To organize this, we don't need to be angry, we need to be focused and united. Because we have receipts to incorporate from as far back as the origins of this country.\n\nThat takes a respectable record of history and working knowledge of constitutional research and legislative review and of course community organizing.",

I'm not saying that someone should do it, because doing so is *super* illegal, *but* one of these days someone should go to a rich neighborhood and take advantage of that lack of security to finally expose Amazon for how terrible their products are to a wider audience. Maybe then Amazon will finally get the message that barely anyone likes most of their products.",

I suppose that source is my gut, based on time frames of when these reports came out, the descriptions of their capabilities, and my decades of experience in the development and evaluation of both internal and 3rd party cyber security platforms, controls, monitoring and detection systems. So, it's absolutely possible that I'm wrong and Palantir has some expertly crafted software that's years ahead of others in the space, but my suspicions are that they are only slightly better in so much as they have a really large data lake to dive into and pattern match against. The AI components tend to be more the trendy tech of the day, and sound good for sales, but their actual results can be a bit chaotic and unreliable unless it's well tested and somewhat battle-worn. \n\nI think the unfortunate part to think about is that that may be perfectly fine for the current leadership at ICE/DHS. I doubt many of them are looking deeply under the hood at the algorithm and risk ratings and weights that are being applied to each piece of data in a profile. It's far more likely that they're giving it a lot more credence than they should, such that even when it gets it wrong, they don't care. They'll go after that person anyway.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

In Minnesota, all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is socially cohesive\u2014because of its diversity and not in spite of it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority. Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about \u201cWestern civilization,\u201d while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.\n\n\"No matter how many more armed men Trump sends to impose his will on the people of Minnesota, all he can do is accentuate their valor. No application of armed violence can make the men with guns as heroic as the people who choose to stand in their path with empty hands in defense of their neighbors. These agents, and the president who sent them, are no one\u2019s heroes, no one\u2019s saviors\u2014just men with guns who have to hide their faces to shoot a mom in the face, and a nurse in the back.\"",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

However they are what's called \"inviolable premises\"  meaning except for under extreme cases the host country needs explicit permission to enter the consult, so yeah foreign soil or not this is a breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention, but these jokers have pretty much proven they don't care about domestic nor international law soooooooo.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

And that regardless what came first or who is taking lead, they end up forming a symbiotic relationship where capital's need to expand and increase profits naturally aligns with colonial plunder and exploitation. \n\nAnd tellingly, when external expansion stagnates or can't grow fast enough, when the inevitable immiseration under capitalism gets worse and worse, the very tools of imperialism: coercion, surveillance, and dispossession, are often repurposed inward, turned against the domestic population to maintain control and profitability.",

As agents were departing, the driver, a U.S. citizen, hit a government vehicle. In fear of public safety and of law enforcement, officers attempted to remove her from the vehicle. She violently resisted, kicking two agents and causing injuries. This agitator was arrested for assault on a federal agent.\u201d\n\n\nIn reality she was just a mom who had dropped a kid off at school heading to work",

They only know how to bluster or retreat.\n\nTwo, there's no safe place left for them in MSP. The hotels where they are staying have been doxxed, \u200bpeople are not letting them sleep, trashing their cars, the lobbies, can't go to restaurants, can't go to the restroom, can't buy gas, etc.\n\nThis is a retreat for them, and a victory for the people.",

        "body": "Meta has started blocking its users from sharing links to [ICE List](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/), a website that has compiled the names of what it claims are [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.wired.com/story/dhs-data-grab-getting-citizens-kicked-off-voter-rolls/) employees, a project the creators say is designed to hold those employees accountable.\n\nDominick Skinner, the creator of ICE List, tells WIRED that links to the website have been shared without issue on Meta\u2019s platforms for more than six months.\n\nAs [agents](https://www.wired.com/story/why-ice-can-kill-with-impunity/) from Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which are under DHS, have continued to terrorize immigrant communities and [kill US citizens](https://www.wired.com/story/the-instant-smear-campaign-against-border-patrol-shooting-victim-alex-pretti/), activists have sought to track and record their activity online in a bid to hold them accountable. But as well as threatening to [prosecute those they claim are \u201cdoxing\u201d ICE agents](https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/16/ice-vowed-doxing-charges-against-portland-anarchists-months-later-no-cases-filed/), the Trump administration has [pressured tech companies](https://apnews.com/article/apple-ice-iphone-app-immigration-fb6a404d3e977516d66d470585071bcc) to block any efforts at crowdsourcing the location and activities of those agents.\n\nICE List has been operating since last June. Skinner says it is run by a core team of five people, including him, as well as hundreds of anonymous volunteers who share information about ICE agents operating in cities across the US.\n\nThe site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but [a WIRED analysis](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/) found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.\n\nSkinner said volunteers he works with across the US first reported problems with posting links on Meta\u2019s platforms on Monday night.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, WIRED verified that posting links to the site was blocked on Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. WIRED also confirmed that links can still be sent on WhatsApp, another Meta-owned product.\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-blocking-links-to-ice-list-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-blocking-links-to-ice-list-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/)",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

I think we are all kinda just stunned how weird the apps acting we all just kind of assumed it would be harder to post without community guideline restrictions....but the glitching is something completely different. Also theyve been reading my private messages alot more and not even allowing some normal conversations to be sent when normally its just trigger words that would get flagged in the DMS. But yeah idk what comes next hopefully it fixes itself and we can find a way to work around the censorship. \n\nThanks for checking in on us \ud83e\udec2",

I do agree that we need to do something about this *yesterday*.\n\nAlso, I think the vast majority of the people who voted for this administration don\u2019t even realize *yet* what they voted for. I have been trying to convince my mom, literally one of the nicest people you could meet, that what\u2019s going on is evil in its entirety. She keeps saying these people they\u2019ve abducted are mostly gang members, pedophiles and rapists. She doesn\u2019t realize that what she\u2019s being told is mostly lies to give justification for this. I do believe she\u2019s getting to her breaking point though. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that she voted for this, that she was duped for the good of the *eCoNoMy*. And that she can do nothing to change this. But if I can get her to see\u2026 I dunno. There\u2019s strength in numbers, even if you\u2019re not able-bodied. \n\nI have a half-black daughter, and I\u2019m scared for her everyday. My daughter feels it. She knows I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s why she\u2019s waking up through the night more frequently I think. I am terrified and in disbelief. I would be out there fighting if I didn\u2019t have her. I would help organize if I could. I hope that people are starting to organize to take back our country. The US used to just be a joke, but now we\u2019re just a terrifying force to be reckoned with. I\u2019m scared for the rest of the world too. This doesn\u2019t stop in the States. And the whole world knows it. I\u2019m sorry to the rest of the world that this is what we\u2019ve become. I wish other countries could help our citizens, but we all know that our military force is tremendous. I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n(Edited for lots of typos)",

I just had no idea there were enough of them to take over the country. I never thought someone like Trump could be elected. I never knew there were so many stupid people, so many willfully ignorant people, so many people who would vote against their own interests just to harm others they view as subhuman. But people who mention the geographic difficulty of all of us coming together and curb stomping the Nazis, I live in a Red state.

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters.

It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.",

It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of half-inch-thick plywood/acrylic/polycarbonate to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nAdditionally, a former firefighters advise: Just adding on here as a former firefighter/medic\n\nTurn riot shields around to deflect their sound weapons back at them. Wear mechanical shop headphones (NOT electronic, those are worse than having no protection!), with ear plugs underneath if you can. The riot shield will also protect you, but not completely. And move laterally (sideways) to evade it, don\u2019t just go backwards.\n\nCarry cartons of milk to neutralize irritants like pepper spray.\n\nBleeding: Get a tourniquet and some occlusive dressings if you can. Super glue can be used to close wounds in a pinch. Bring a sharpie in case you need to write down the time you applied a tourniquet: write it on the tourniquet itself, on the limb, and on the victim\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s extremely important. And only apply the tourniquet if you\u2019ve already tried to stop the bleeding with direct pressure and failed.\n\nDirect pressure means putting your FULL WEIGHT on the wound, not just holding tightly. You should be leaning on the victim with your shoulders lined up above your hands the same way you would while performing CPR. Depending on the depth of the wound you may need to pack it with gauze using your fingers. If you don\u2019t have gauze, any cloth will work, no matter if it\u2019s dirty or not \u2014 antibiotics can be given at the ER. It is going to hurt a lot. Tourniquets hurt even worse. Don\u2019t let it deter you.\n\nOcclusive dressings: Chest wounds that are making \u201csucking\u201d or hissing sounds can quickly lead to lung collapse. Apply an occlusive dressing with only 3 sides taped down. This creates a flutter valve to allow the trapped air out and not in.",

That might include, for instance,\u00a0an audit\u00a0of the\u00a0I-9\u00a0employee eligibility verification forms that must be completed by employers and those they hire.\n\nThat preparation shouldn\u2019t be confined to higher-ups. It should involve all employees, including frontline workers, because they may be the first point of contact once ICE arrives, said Shanon Stevenson, a partner at labor and employment law firm\u00a0Fisher Phillips. The firm provides clients with a\u00a0preparedness checklist\u00a0for ICE audits and raids. Every workplace should designate an onsite manager to be an immigration point person, Stevenson said.\n\nThis person should ask to see any warrants from the ICE agents and email a copy to the employer\u2019s immigration attorney. That attorney should quickly review the scope of access that the warrant allows. ICE doesn\u2019t need a warrant to access areas that are open to the public, such as lobbies and parking lots.\n\nBut to gain access to non-public parts of a workplace \u2013 such as employee break rooms, private offices or warehouse floors - ICE will need either: (a) the express consent of the employer; or (b) a judicial warrant, which will have the court\u2019s name at the top and a judge\u2019s signature at the bottom.",

I've said from the beginning they wouldn't be brave enough to pull their shit here. I'm still not convinced. But watch us closely the next couple months to see what happens.\n\nWe don't have \"immigrant neighborhoods.\" Everyone is rolled into the same neighborhoods here. And our state government lives off the NRA teat. We have no gun laws. It's perfectly legal to be a teen and walk around with an ar-15 at your side, and plenty do.\n\nWe have immigrants all throughout our city from war torn countries. I know of some who have literally taken rabble rousers in bars and physically thrown them out the doors. People here aren't afraid. They have survived wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Palestine, etc.\n\nAdd that to an already bitter angry public. The cases of childhood lead poisoning here are tragic. We had lead mines around the region for years. It erodes brain rationalization function, and we have 100's or 1000's here. Civil rights issues (Dred Scott happened right here.) Remember Ferguson riots? Ferguson is our suburb. There was even a news story some years ago about a mugger trying to rob a St. Louisan in Seattle at gun point. The man kept saying \"I'm from STL. I ain't giving you shit. But I'll throw hands at you right now.\" He actually scared off the mugger who had a gun just by reiterating he was from ST. Louis. \n\nMark my words, this place is going to be the catalyst for civil war if ICE starts going door to door or stopping non-white people driving down the street. We are NOT Minnesota nice. This is a city already full of rage. ICE can't hit an immigrant neighborhood here. We are all mixed together. And even the immigrant whites have a history. I have known multiple people just a couple decades ago involved in deaths with Italian Mafia. Someone in our city will kill an agent and not think twice. Cops get shot at here or targeted with a moving vehicle on the regular for nothing. It's happened within the last week here they drove at a cop head on. Agents start going door to door and bashing in people's doors and dragging them out? One will get shot in a week tops and the whole damn neighborhood will swear they saw nothing and delete their Ring camera footage. There isn't a person in this city who hasn't had gunfire close by or seen a dead body. We are HARD.\n\nIt's going to get very ugly very soon. Please keep us in your prayers to God or Allah or Buddha or Mother Earth. But we WILL be the ones to stop them from continuing throughout the country eroding civil liberties. Meal team 6 is no match for your average soccer mom in the STL. We've (well I'm not a soccer mom but a volleyball one) dealt with more gunfire in the past year than those pussies have in their lifetimes. We got you, America.",

If you're connected to the internet and your cameras are wireless, be that local RF or WiFi connected, law enforcement can access them without a second thought. I've seen first hand, how easy it is for law enforcement to access your router and fish through your stuff. Also they have equipment that sniffs for access points such as  Bluetooth and can access your location, name and other details, without your knowledge; so switch off Bluetooth on your mobiles and disconnect or switch off wireless cameras that you have. This includes baby monitors/ Nanny Cams etc. in particular. \n\nIt may sound paranoid however, if you don't need a WiFi connection at home and you have the option, disable that as well. If you must have it on, change the WiFi name to something that doesn't identify you and also the name of your mobile phone, within the settings. Also switch off GPS, or at least switch off location sharing and you've done all you can to protect yourself from electronic intrusion. \n\nI wouldn't bother switching off your mobiles, as it's a lifeline that you may just need and unless you have it in a really good quality Faraday bag, they can activate it for a network ping anyway! \n\nKeep calm and keep yourselves safe. It's clear that no one is immune to the violence if ICE Agents, so the best advice is to do what you can to avoid and evade. Give them little to no opportunity for one to one interaction.",

We have two senators that are trump sycophants. Our last AG became a deputy director of the FBI.\n\nThe federal government knows our state. They know the powder keg the Republicans created here with even denying a law we tried to say minors couldn't carry guns without parental supervision (yes, minors can actually walk around with guns here without parental consent, it's insane.)\n\nWithout doxing myself, I used to work for the government. I've met several of these people. I lived in KC for several years too. The impression I got from the politicians I met is they have a healthy fear of STL'ians like the healthy fear I have of wildlife when hiking. I agree the ICE thugs will have a bloodlust to come here. But their puppet masters know the situation.\n\nRemember Ferguson? It was actually a Dem who got the NG to come here to calm tension (they never attacked, but were under Dem leadership.) Republicans were scared.\n\nStockley riots I mentioned in another comment were just as bad. We had changed to a Rep governor then. No national guard came. The f'ing police station was set on fire. Cop car burned. Nope, no NG was sent.\n\nThe state govt tries to f' with us with laws. But they are afraid to come physically in our city. Just a couple years ago these Republicans tried to set up a meeting in our city to discuss state taking over police and some laws they were trying to pass. We organized to come to that meeting. They cancelled it. They set up another at a LE location and kept it under the rug. I am politically involved and still didn't find out myself until the last minute. Only two of us who were anti the Gestapo were able to show up at their last minute meeting. And even though it was an LE location, they still seemed uncomfortable and avoided us. It was me a tiny woman and a senior citizen.\n\nSo no matter how bloodthirsty these goons are, from what I've seen their puppet masters will treat it differently here. STL is definitely a place we should watch in these times.",

There are agents here but like op said not in large numbers and we do not have true neighborhoods or pockets of immigrants like other blue cities. We're so enmeshed, even in the county, that any altercations will be witnessed by people who are not at risk. And that will jeopardize every mission ICE goes on. We're dense enough to never be alone.

And the general public is even angrier now than they were then.\n\nSo did I do a better job this time of explaining my fears? If people violently rioted over that guy, what do you think is going to happen if they start busting out car windows or using battering rams to drag out non-white people? And it's not the immigrants that will be violent. The Latino and Afrikaan people here are typically quiet and peaceful. Bosnians are known to be rough, but not anti police (the literal picking up people causing problems and throwing them out the business door are the Bosnians.) Nope, it's going to be the people born and raised here who have the ICE goons in their neighborhoods stopping people for papers and busting car windows that are going to be the ones to snap.\n\nAnd media won't cover it honestly, just like they didn't with Ferguson or Jason Stockley riots. Just please watch for those of us who will be recording and posting here. It's going to get ugly if they actually show up here in significant numbers.",

It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.",

Start using firefox instead of chrome. Call your reps daily. PRESSURE people of influence on social media and tell them to call for a general strike! Talk to your neighbors about how you feel and get them engaged. SHARE THIS COMMENT! COPY AND PASTE IT! Stay angry, it's a great motivator. Protest. Be kind to your neighbors! Stop participating in a rigged economy and stand in solidarity!\n\nWe must be uncomfortable and so discomfort.

It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.",

I would get arrested and charged with murder. How can it be legal for ICE agents to even \\_touch\\_ a non-immigrant? It can't be part of their job description that they can hurt / kill people surely? They shouldn't even be allowed to spray or tase people who are simply protesting what they're doing.\n\nCan't the legal system in the US   \n1) ensure that ICE agents need to be identifiable at all times (no masks, badges, must respond if asked),   \n2) be arrested by law enforcement if they enact violence that isn't a natural part of an illegal immigrant arrest? (And be able to PROVE it was necessary.)   \n3) allow for the agent to be immediately dismissed if they act outside of their job description,   \n4) ensure law enforcement are clearly mandated to protect citizens being attacked regardless of who is attacking them?",

But ICE is allowed to break the law all the time and nothing happens to them.\n\nFor example, the killers of Good and Pretti have not been charged with murder, even though they very clearly murdered someone. Another example is ICE breaking into people's houses without a judicial warrant, which violates the 4th Amendment. Another example is the fact that members of Congress are often not allowed to go into immigration detention facilities, but they're legally supposed to be allowed to go in and inspect. One more example is the fact that the Fort Bliss detention center has had [60 violations of federal detention standards in 50 days. ](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/detained-immigrants-detail-physical-abuse-and-inhumane-conditions-at-largest-immigration-detention-center-in-the-u-s)And yet, there are no consequences, so the standards are useless.\n\nEven aside from ICE, there are [tons of other things this administration does that are illegal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hybL-GJov7M), and it doesn't matter because there are no consequences for all the illegal activity.",

The limits of these laws have not been tested, so the administration is claiming they have broad powers. If local police behaved as if that weren't true, then the dispute would have to work its way through the court system, and it would probably end up at the Supreme Court. The SC is stacked with conservatives, who have ruled again and again in Trump's favor, even when, to casual observers, their rulings seemed to contradict the Constitution.\n\nSo any local police force on the wrong side of that would be in legal jeopardy.\n\nAs to where Congress is? I don't know. That's kind of the big question. They Democrats are threatening to shut down the federal government this week. Their demand is to defund ICE. How that will play out is hard to predict. The Democrats don't have a lot of leverage, because the GOP hates most government functions.\n\nDuring a shutdown, Trump can choose which government functions are \"essential,\" and keep funding them for awhile. He'll call ICE essential and say food stamps, welfare and healthcare are inessential. So the pain of a shutdown is real and the benefits are always uncertain. \n\nPeople are frustrated, and so am I. At the same time, as an amateur observer of government, I can't see much leverage for Democrats in the short term. It seems like the street level resistance we've had from citizens in MN is the most effective we've seen in a while. But it comes at a steep price.",

What\u2019s distinctive about it is that the film interviews real perpetrators, not just survivors, and lets them reenact and talk about their actions decades later. Some of them grapple with how to face what they did, and the film explores their psychology and denial.\nPeople sometimes recall this documentary as showing perpetrators coping with their guilt, nervous habits, or how they rationalize what they did and discussions about trauma and self-perception includes scenes that feel like coping mechanisms\"\n\nHeres the trailer but the full doc is free on youtube as well -\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Q3FcB1UZHlg?si=FvXl70Uyf5CEamdJ",

Hitler himself became increasingly dependent on injections of a cocktail of drugs\u2014ultimately including Eukodal, a cousin of heroin\u2014administered by his personal doctor.\n\nThoroughly researched and rivetingly readable, Blitzed throws light on a history that, until now, has remained in the shadows.\u201d",

It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, and hard-backed books.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters. It would be a shame if protesters used leaf blowers to blow the gas away.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.",

      "author": "LostHominoid",
      "subreddit": "ICE_Raids",
      "text": "Look at this photo from 2017. Really look at it.\n\nIt\u2019s the moment the \"resistance\" became a business partnership. While they tell us they are enemies on TV, this image shows Chuck Schumer leaning in, whispering, and cutting deals with Donald Trump behind a closed Oval Office door. A hot mic later caught Schumer admitting, \"He likes me... anyway\".\n\nFast forward to January 2026, and we are seeing the deadly fruit of those whispers.\n\nIn Minneapolis, federal agents have turned our streets into a war zone under **Operation Metro Surge**. We\u2019ve watched the execution of ICU nurse **Alex Pretti**, who was tackled and shot 10 times while filming on his phone. We saw **Renee Good** shot to death in her own car. These aren't accidents; they are the result of the **$170 billion \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA)** a massive enforcement check that the Democratic establishment helped grease.\n\n**The Performance: Enter Tim Walz.** \n\nNow we see the latest act in the play: **Governor Tim Walz activating the National Guard.**\n\nThe news is full of footage showing the Guard \"lowering the temperature\" by handing out coffee and donuts to protesters. **What is the point of a donut when the people getting it are being hunted by the \"ICE Gestapo\" the next morning?** This is \"Donut Diplomacy.\" It\u2019s designed to make you think the Democrats are \"protecting\" the community while they refuse to actually block the 3,000 federal agents occupying our city. They are using the National Guard to act as a \"buffer\" to ensure the masses don't realize the party has already agreed to work with ICE.\n\nThe deal is simple: ICE gets to run its raids and maintain the status quo, and in exchange, they don't expose the fact that Democratic leadership signed off on the funding. They pop up on TV, express \"disappointment\" and \"anger,\" and then go home while the cycle restarts in the next state.\n\nThe blood in Minneapolis isn\u2019t just on Trump's hands. It\u2019s on the hands of every \"opposition\" leader who whispers in the Oval Office and sends the National Guard to hand out snacks while our neighbors are murdered.\n\n**Stop watching the speeches and start watching the lack of results. They are all on the same team.**\n\nNow that I have typed all this up, I honestly hope I get downvoted to oblivion, called names for making stupid points. I want to be so wrong that I feel shame to have caused anyone anxiety and depression if they believe what I said and it turns out to be false. I want to be ridiculed when all this passes simply because the reality of my words is not what I want. It will cause more harm to the country if we find out that all of the government has gaslighted us and really does not care about us, but the issue is that my opinion is based on my observation, and all that I am seeing keeps leading me to this conclusion. Thank you for reading my post and I would love to see what you guys think. If you agree with my post dont reply with words along the lines of agreeing with me. I want you to jump straight into what we are going to do next if any of what I said is true. Lets talk about the next step. ",

Governor Tim Walz has the absolute authority under the 10th Amendment and the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine (upheld in *Printz v. United States*) to refuse any state cooperation with ICE.\n\nInstead of using the National Guard to physically block federal agents or protect residents, Walz has them in reflective vests handing out coffee and donuts to \"lower the temperature\"\n\nIf they were truly \"squat,\" they wouldn't be able to deploy the Guard at all. They are choosing to use that power as a PR buffer rather than a shield.\n\n2. the **$170 billion** One Big Beautiful Bill passed in July 2025 didn't happen in a vacuum.  \n$75 billion of that was carved out specifically for ICE\u2019s interior enforcement the very money paying for the \"Metro Surge\" agents who killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nTo pass a bill that large, you need cross-party \"whispers\" and deals. They traded that enforcement funding for other priorities, proving they view our safety as a bargaining chip.\n\nAnd Finally 3. the State Attorneys General like Keith Ellison have the power to charge federal agents with state crimes, including murder.\n\nWhile federal agents have \"qualified immunity,\" the Supreme Court has ruled that this doesn't apply when they act outside their \"lawful duties\" like shooting a pinned, unarmed nurse 10 times.\n\nIf Ellison were serious, he\u2019d be issuing arrest warrants for the agents involved in the Minneapolis killings instead of just filing \"lawsuits\" to \"limit the scope\" of the surge. Lawsuits take years; handcuffs take minutes.",

The \"lawful duties\" determination would start in state court and then almost definitely be appealed to federal courts after the determination by the state court.

It would go to the federal courts because it is a case between state attorneys and (likely) federal government attorneys representing the agents and CBP.\n\n\nThis pattern likely would continue all the way to the US Supreme Court.",

Finally at 60 senators, enough to overcome the republican fillibuster.\n\n\nThen Ted Kennedy dies in August, bringing the Dems back to 59. This supermajority period lasts about 8 weeks/2 months.\n\n\nHis interim replacement is appointed at the end of September. Then Scott Brown wins the special election and is appointed is sworn in February of 2010.

Some prioritize abolishing or restructuring ICE, while others focus on oversight, accountability, and legislative reform.

Every vote for a third party in a competitive race functionally helps whichever major party you oppose more. That's not defeatism, it's math.\n\nWhat actually works:\n\nThe Tea Party and progressive movements both reshaped their parties by winning primaries, not by starting from scratch. You can replace establishment candidates without building an entire parallel infrastructure.\n\nWant to prove a movement has legs? Win city councils, state legislatures, school boards. Build a bench of candidates with track records. Third parties that skip straight to presidential runs are unserious.\n\nIf you actually want third parties to be viable, fight for voting systems that allow them. Until then, you're just helping your opponents.\n\nThe \"mobilize a third party\" call sounds principled but is practically a recipe for handing power to whoever you disagree with most. If you're serious about change, do the unglamorous work of winning primaries and building coalitions within existing structures. That's how movements actually gain power in American politics.",

The Obama and Biden administrations issued prosecutorial discretion memos that dramatically changed *how* ICE operates - prioritizing serious criminals over families, limiting workplace raids, and implementing programs like DACA. Trump eliminated these protections and directed ICE to pursue anyone regardless of criminal history. Same agency, vastly different impacts on people's lives.\n\n**The electoral math problem:**\n\nPolls consistently show that swing voters - the ones who decide close elections - support immigration enforcement even if they want it done more humanely. A party that campaigns on abolishing ICE would likely lose the Senate seats in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania that give them any power at all. Then you get *more* enforcement with *fewer* protections.\n\n**What \"doing something\" actually looks like:**\n\nBiden ended family separation, restored asylum processing, expanded humanitarian parole programs, and provided legal status to hundreds of thousands through various programs. These aren't nothing - they're the difference between families being torn apart or staying together. Incremental progress isn't sexy, but it materially changes lives.\n\nThe question isn't whether Democrats are perfect on immigration - they're clearly not. It's whether the outcomes under Democratic vs. Republican control are meaningfully different for immigrants, and whether working within the system produces better results than abandoning it entirely.",

Over half of Congress was a\u00a0 millionaires before they even arrived in dc. they are already starting from a baseline that most Americans will never reach.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a salary of\u00a0 $174,000 their net worth often grows at a pace that suggest both the left and right are playing on the same winning team.\n\n\n\u00a0For example some studies show, House members from both parties have historically beat the stock market by about 6% annually, which points to a shared advantage that transcends politicsA ad a need for reform when it comes to insider trading.\n\nThe Presidency is the ultimate wealth pipeline regardless of which side of the aisle you are on. The Clintons and Obamas both entered the White House with roughly $1M and exited with book deals and speaking tours worth tens of millions.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump and family have leveraged the office to secure foreign real estate projects in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, launch crypto ventures, and land multi-million dollar media deals like Melania\u2019s Amazon documentary. Not to mention the plethora of trump swag you can buy. I don't recall exactly no I think it was his grand daughter was also trying to start her own clothing\u00a0 brand from the white house lawn.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0By maintaining ownership of their global business while in power, they\u2019ve effectively turned the highest office into a corporate engine.\u00a0\n\n\nthe \"rich vs. poor\" divide transcends left and right; at that level, the presidency, and Congress are just a finely tuned capital generating machine, a revolving door to high paying lobbying jobs and unique market insights that ensure\u00a0 politicians leave DC significantly richer than they started.\u00a0There are top gainers on both sides making it clear that while they argue on TV, they profit.\n\n\nLet's start with a whole new batch, impose strict term limits to get rid of career politicians.

Its funding levels and enforcement priorities have shifted repeatedly under different presidents and different congressional majorities. That means today\u2019s issues stem from **years of policy choices**, not one vote from 2001.\n\nIf the goal is to change how immigration enforcement works, focusing on current legislation, oversight, and budget negotiations is far more effective than retroactively assigning blame for a vote cast in an entirely different political moment.",
