This assertion seems to ignore the results of the 'Motor-Voter' law enacted during the Obama administration. eohrnberger said: . . . Welfare offices and other agencies in 49 US states are providing voter registration forms to migrants without requiring proof of citizenship , leading Republicans and conservatives to call for swift federal action to stop the handouts.​ ​ Every state but Arizona — which recently passed a law barring the practice on state but not federal forms — gives applicants for either welfare benefits, driver’s licenses, or in some cases, mail-in ballots voter registration forms without demanding proof of citizenship.​ ​ There is currently no requirement on federal voting forms to provide proof of US citizenship , though it is illegal to falsely claim one is a citizen or for a non-citizen to cast a ballot in a federal election.​ ​ But millions of migrants with humanitarian parole, refugee or asylum status are eligible for benefits that would bring them to the offices where voter registration takes place.​ How non-citizens are getting voter registration forms across the US — and how Republicans are trying to stop it Welfare offices and other agencies in 49 US states are providing voter registration forms to migrants without requiring proof of citizenship, leading Republicans and conservatives to call for swift… nypost.com Legitimate concerns expressed by: “While Biden and radical progressive Democrats give ISIS and criminals an app to literally schedule their illegal entry, Republicans must fight any chance of illegal voter registration until we can mass deport,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who introduced the measure, told The Post.​ ​ “As President Biden has welcomed millions of illegal aliens through our borders, including sophisticated criminal syndicates and foreign adversaries, it is incumbent upon Congress to implement greater enforcement measures that secure the voter registration process and ensure only American citizens decide the outcome of American elections,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement following its approval.​ ​ “It is undeniable that the current structure makes it possible for illegal immigrants and non-citizens to vote — and the American people have no way of knowing how widespread the problem may be,” Ryan Walker, executive vice president at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s sister group, Heritage Action, told The Post.​ ​ “The SAVE Act puts all of these issues to rest and gives Americans confidence that our elections are decided on a more even playing field,” Walker said.​ ​ House Republican leaders have yet to schedule a floor vote for the measure, though one Hill source suggested to The Post it could come up before the August recess.​ Of course, the left doesn't see it that way: The left-leaning Campaign Legal Center has opposed the SAVE Act as a “shameful” measure that will “undermine trust in the electoral process,” dismissing concerns over non-citizen voting and declaring it has not taken place “at any meaningful level.”​ All you have to ask yourself, \"Why don't Democrats want to make it harder for illegal voters to vote?\" The answer to that question is obvious: They perceive political advantage in NOT doing so.

I will say this about revolvers they're never going to jam. And I always thought the quickest reload was just a second gun or third and revolvers can be very light and very small so carrying three of them is not a problem but fire until it's empty and drop it and get another one. But there is something to be said for assuming automatic firm where you don't have to train that way. And you don't have to carry three of them but I would still always carry a semi-automatic and a revolver backup."}

Where does it say that in the Constitution? (It doesn't) Click to expand... Sure it does, the 2A mentions the security of a free state so there you have it. BabaVoss said: Yes indeed. Good luck trying to standup against any modern military with your home arsenal. Click to expand... It wouldn't just be me, there are over 80 million gun owners in the USA, the total number of active police officers and military personnel in the USA is under 5 million. BabaVoss said: This are vehicles in which the weapons have been disabled. Click to expand... And somebody who knows what they're doing can get them working. BabaVoss said: Restricting the capacity of magazines does not infringe on anyone's rights. You've repeatedly pointed out that it is almost no detriment to their use. So what's the problem? Click to expand... If the police and military can use magazines over a certain size so should citizens who aren't in the police and military be allowed to use them. If you want to restrict citizens from magazines over a certain size, restrict such magazines from the police and military too. BabaVoss said: You should not. That is a lot of flammable liquid to be carrying around. Unsafe and very inefficient. 100 Gals of gas would require a tank of over 13 cubic feet in volume and adding 600 lbs to your vehicle's weight - which would have to taken into account in its design. Car makers have efficiency targets they try to meet, and woudl be very likely to build such an inefficient vehicle. Click to expand... They make trucks that have over 100 gallon gas tanks, legal to own and drive. BabaVoss said: You've already admitted that it does take some amount of time, however small, to change magazines. The same applies to picking up another gun. Click to expand... And it also takes some amount of time to get off another shot after firing a previous shot, something we agree on, your point? BabaVoss said: Another point against having them. Click to expand... No that's a point why some people might not want to use them, not a point on why they should be illegal. BabaVoss said: Even if it is just a \"split-second\", it could be enough time that one less person gets killed or one more gets to safety. Makes it worth it my book. Why not yours? Several people got hit in Las Vegas as they were running towards cover. I would think this obvious. You assume perfection in every instance of a mass shooting - but of course you cannot guarantee that. Why not make it a little harder for a mass murderer, since you have admitted it is no big deal to anyone else. Click to expand... A split second isn't enough time to get to safety but even if it was, even if switching magazines or guns does give a victim enough time to get to safety, laws banning magazines over a certain size won't do any good because criminals will just use the magazines that are over that size anyway, criminals don't obey the law that's what makes them criminals. BabaVoss said: If changing guns or magazines is so effortless, as you have insisted, why are you arguing against doing so for that possible chance to save a life? Seems like it should be no big deal. Click to expand... If it's so effortless than banning large magazines won't do any good anyway and besides, as I said, criminals will use the larger magazines anyway. And if it's no big deal for citizens to not have access to larger magazines then it would be no big deal for the police and military to have access to those same magazines. BabaVoss said: Makes no sense to me. Click to expand... As I said, they make trucks with gas tanks that hold 100 gallons or more and they're legal, legal to own, legal to drive around town, and so forth,"}

Police officers were for decades the ultimate traditionalists on sidearms. The double-action .38 revolver is literally the police stereotype even today because a huge proportion of the police simply ignored the semiautomatic pistol for fifty-plus years. Yes, magnums were a thing, but policing entered the 80s with wheel guns for the most part. Limited ammunition aboard is why the 90s and 2000s cops carry semiautomatic pistols. Click to expand... Yep. Back in the late 70s I used to do some gun trading and shooting with some cops. One in particular carried a Mod. 19 S&W, and was very dismissive of my Combat Commander Colt. I don't believe there were a great many autos with a double action trigger pull in those days, though the Illinois State Police did adopt the Model 39 Smith and Wesson in the mid-60s."}

But I don’t want to be there,” said Christian Pion, 31, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris . He became a U.S. citizen last year, a decade after coming to the United States from the Dominican Republic, and cast his first presidential ballot for Trump. “God doesn’t want you to be poor.” Next to him, his best friend, Willy J. Castillo, 39, who owns the shop and others, worked the register as he talked about Trump’s drive to succeed, overcome and survive. Castillo, who also voted for Trump, identifies with that: “The Bible says ‘God helps those who help themselves,’ right?” The mix of hope, drive for success and belief in a God who rewards faith, sometimes with financial accomplishments, has become dominant across the United States and Latin America, experts on Latino religion say. The belief system is sometimes called “seed faith,” “health and wealth gospel,” or “prosperity gospel.”\" Link This is pretty funny. In fact, the Bible does not say God helps those who help themselves. How classic is it that their support for him is based on a lie, even though it isn't one of his? Click to expand... Yeah the Bible doesn't say a particular phrase is derived from biblical concepts. Have you not ever read a fable such as the fox and the fox and the sour grapes?

Sounds more like the attitude of progressive and DEMS Christians who had gone pro-choice and pro-sex-same marriage ............don't you think so? Biden's attitude would be like the sinner who was being described (the brazen sinner on line 1), who struts coming to church. I have read that Biden was threatened by the church with EX-COMMUNICATION due to his pro-choice stance and policy. Biden's views on abortion, is an open fact !

ElectionGuard available today to enable secure, verifiable voting​ Sep 24, 2019 Tom Burt - Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-...ble-today-to-enable-secure-verifiable-voting/ ​ Microsoft aims to modernize and secure voting with ElectionGuard Devin Coldewey 8:39 AM PDT • May 6, 2019​ When it comes to voting, we’ve come a long way from dropping pebbles into an amphora — but still not nearly far enough if the lack of confidence in our election systems is any indication. Microsoft is the first major tech company to take on this problem with a new platform it calls ElectionGuard that promises to make elections more secure and transparent — and yes, it’s free and open source. Set to be made available this summer and piloted during the 2020 elections, ElectionGuard is not a complete voting machine, but rather a platform for handling voting data that can either empower existing systems or have new ones built on top of it. It’s part of the Defending Democracy Program and sister product to the similarly named NewsGuard and AccountGuard , which appeared last year. The basic idea is to let voters track their votes securely and privately, while also allowing authorities to tabulate, store and, if necessary, audit them. As Microsoft puts it: ElectionGuard provides a complete implementation of end-to-end verifiable elections. It is designed to work with systems that use paper ballots, supplementing today’s tabulation process by providing a means of public verification of the accuracy of reported results. Click to expand... The platform would sit underneath existing voting systems, and when a voter casts their ballot, the data would be entered in the ordinary fashion in a state’s election systems, but also in ElectionGuard. The voter would then be given a tracking code that lets them see that their vote has been, say, recorded locally at the correct polling place, or perhaps that it has been sent on to state authorities for auditing. https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/microsoft-aims-to-modernize-and-secure-voting-with-electionguard/ now Orange guy can't spill all the beans, he works for deeeper state, but the sheep still love the guy. good actor and a fun TV show back in the day. more drama please. thank you deeeper state guys ​"}

Investigators say he admitted in a recorded interview to killing Nagamallaiah. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed it assisted Dallas police during the interrogation. In a statement, ICE said, “Cobos-Martinez did the unthinkable and proceeded to kick the head around like a soccer ball.” The agency said he had been held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson until January 13, when he was released under supervision because there were “no removal flights to Cuba.” But WFAA found government videos and news coverage showing deportation flights had resumed in 2023. Court records show Cobos-Martinez has a violent history stretching back years. In 2017, he was arrested in South Lake Tahoe, California, after attempting to carjack a 22-year-old woman while naked, according to KRNV. Police said he tried to drag the woman from her car, climbed inside with her still there, and attempted to steal it before bystanders pulled him out. He was charged with carjacking and false imprisonment, booked into the El Dorado County Jail, and later released on bail.

Cobos-Martinez had been living and working at the motel, according to police and witnesses. Witnesses told police he argued with Nagamallaiah, retrieved a machete, and began attacking him. One woman, who asked not to be identified, described the attack in horrifying detail. The witness said the victim fled from Cobos-Martinez but tripped and fell. \"He just started whacking at his neck,\" the witness said. \"Once he decapitated him, he kicked the head and then he picked it up and then he threw it in the trash can. I couldn't believe he would do another human being like that.\" Police arrested Cobos-Martinez minutes later, still armed with the machete and covered in blood. Investigators say he admitted in a recorded interview to killing Nagamallaiah. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed it assisted Dallas police during the interrogation. In a statement, ICE said, “Cobos-Martinez did the unthinkable and proceeded to kick the head around like a soccer ball.” The agency said he had been held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson until January 13, when he was released under supervision because there were “no removal flights to Cuba.” But WFAA found government videos and news coverage showing deportation flights had resumed in 2023. Court records show Cobos-Martinez has a violent history stretching back years. In 2017, he was arrested in South Lake Tahoe, California, after attempting to carjack a 22-year-old woman while naked, according to KRNV. Police said he tried to drag the woman from her car, climbed inside with her still there, and attempted to steal it before bystanders pulled him out. He was charged with carjacking and false imprisonment, booked into the El Dorado County Jail, and later released on bail."}

The Senate bill redefines “detention” to “noncustodial detention” and applies this supervised release-by-another-name only to adults. If passed into law, families and children would be released without supervision. Worse, the bill codifies the Flores settlement agreement, as interpreted by a single U.S. district judge in California, who ruled that unaccompanied aliens could not be in immigration detention longer than 20 days. She later expanded her ruling to accompanied aliens, meaning families. This bill encourages more child recycling by cartels so that more aliens would pose as families to avoid even supervised releas e. DHS Enforcement Lifecycle Reports show that ali ens released from detention are rarely removed and are far less likely to abide by a court-issued deportation order . Noncustodial release will result in a significant increase in the alien fugitive backlog. Expands and codifies Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s mass parole abuse. The Senate should have adopted the parole-narrowing text from the House-passed bill, the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2). Instead, the Senate bill expands parole beyond exigent medical circumstances and a significant law enforcement or intelligence purpose for those arriving at or between land ports of entry. It includes other urgent humanitarian reasons, religious and cultural celebrations, and permits an accompanying alien to join the principal alien.

Some family groups are hard to detain, so those groups will have alternative to detention, fast hearings and one limited appeal. Those who do not qualify will be removed.

This alone will dramatically reduce the number of people allowed through the asylum screening process. WHY do we allow this now? Click to expand... Paradoxical said: Each of these changes would reduce dramatically the number of people eligible to even apply for asylum, but together they will be a powerful tool for any administration willing to enforce the law. That's because right now Mayorkass gives people a cell phone and coaching that all they need to say is \"ASYLUM\" Click to expand... And here again it is YOU who wants to keep giving out the cell phones because YOU oppose the bill. Paradoxical said: ENDS PAROLE CATCH-AND-RELEASE FIASCO AT THE BORDER WHY do we allow this now? Ends Biden’s use of catch-and-release through the CBPOne app to hand out work permits for free along the southwest border. WHY do we allow this now? Note that he admits this is BIDEN'S doing. Thank goodness he told the truth there, The definition of humanitarian parole is clarified to stop the daily flagrant abuse of the authority at the border. We need to change the definition by a bill? Click to expand... Yes, typically those kinds definitions are codified. Why would you NOT want a tougher definition codified? Paradoxical said: This change alone will stop over half-a-million border crossings every year. There a HALF MILLION illegals on parole in the United States and people say they commit fewer crimes? No wonder Americans are being robbed, raped and murdered. We have all these bleeding heart liberals who want convicted felon paolees to remain in the United States. Click to expand... And YOU want to keep it that way. Paradoxical said: BUILDS THE WALL Provides $650 million to build and reinforce miles and miles of new border wall. The one that Biden and Mayortkass sold off because they said a wall is unjust? The same wall that they refused to let Trump build? Why the change of heart? I thought a wall did nothing. Click to expand... Perhaps you’ve never heard of the words compromise or bipartisan? Paradoxical said: It also withholds the majority of the wall money to be used during the next administration. RADICAL CHANGE FROM CATCH AND RELEASE TO ENFORCE AND DEPORT Increases Border Patrol recruitment and streamlines hiring. If they didn't catch and release now we wouldn't need more agents. Funding for more ICE Agents and ICE detention beds. 50 THOUSAND plus beds instead of implementing Remain in Mexico for which NO BILL is needed??!! Since these guys can just willy-nilly pass bills with all manner of regulations, they can pass a \"Remain in Mexico\" bill, can't they? Problem solved. No worry about bleeding hearts saying it is \"unfair\" Funding for effective mandatory monitoring. Funding for ICE removal operations (flights and buses back home). This is BS. They don't need permission or funding to do this Click to expand... Are you just being silly here or are you saying that busses and planes are free? Paradoxical said: Uses direct hire procedures to increase ICE deportation officers and enforcement and removal personnel to ensure that illegal migrants can be quickly repatriated to their home countries. Click to expand... Why do we do this now? Because that’s what the current laws either require or permit. We have been doing this for years. Even Trump did not deport a higher percentage of illegal immigrants than Biden. The new law would have changed all that but you oppose that change and Trump killed it. The REAL question is why do you want to keep the current situation? Paradoxical said: If Mayorkass didn't have open borders we wouldn't have 5000 a day coming over. He WANTS them all here. He and Biden have said so. This bill does nothing except allow them to stall for another two or three years at which time they will have accomplished their goal of 25 million \"newcomers\" here. Click to expand... B. S. I can see you are frustrated now. I can see why given that every time you try to make an actual factual debate point it falls apart. Why do you want to keep the current situation? Why don’t you want to make the situation better?"}

Obviously the plan is NOT to put all of the detention beds in one city. The idea that they would cart people from all around the country to one place is ridiculous. Where did you come up with that idea? But I imagine you have no problem with Trump’s camps. From the NYT: “More broadly, Mr. Miller said a new Trump administration would shift from the ICE practice of arresting specific people to carrying out workplace raids and other sweeps in public places aimed at arresting scores of unauthorized immigrants at once. To make the process of finding and deporting undocumented immigrants already living inside the country “radically more quick and efficient,” he said, the Trump team would bring in “ the right kinds of attorneys and the right kinds of policy thinkers” willing to carry out such ideas. And because of the magnitude of arrests and deportations being contemplated, they plan to build “vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers” for immigrants as their cases progress and they wait to be flown to other countries. Mr. Miller said the new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border.” He said the military would construct them under the authority and control of the Department of Homeland Security. While he cautioned that there were no specific blueprints yet, he said the camps would look professional and similar to other facilities for migrants that have been built near the border . Such camps could also enable the government to speed up the pace and volume of deportations of undocumented people who have lived in the United States for years and so are not subject to fast-track removal. If pursuing a long-shot effort to win permission to remain in the country would mean staying locked up in the interim, some may give up and voluntarily accept removal without going through the full process. The use of these camps, Mr. Miller said, would likely be focused more on single adults because the government cannot indefinitely hold children under a longstanding court order known as the Flores settlement. So any families brought to the facilities would have to be moved in and out more quickly, he said. The Trump administration tried to overturn the Flores settlement, but the Supreme Court did not resolve the matter before Mr. Trump’s term ended. Mr. Miller said the Trump team would try again. To increase the number of agents available for ICE sweeps, Mr. Miller said, officials from other federal law enforcement agencies would be temporarily reassigned, and state National Guard troops and local police officers, at least from willing Republican-led states, would be deputized for immigration control efforts. While a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the armed forces for law enforcement purposes, another law called the Insurrection Act creates an exception. Mr. Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act at the border, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants, Mr. Miller said.” “Trump advisers’ vision of abrupt mass deportations would be a recipe for social and economic turmoil, disrupting the housing market and major industries including agriculture and the service sector. Mr. Miller cast such disruption in a favorable light. “Mass deportation will be a labor-market disruption celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs,” he said. “Americans will also celebrate the fact that our nation’s laws are now being applied equally, and that one select group is no longer magically exempt.”” Instead of “who’s going to build the wall” the next rallying call is going to be “who’s going to mow the lawn,”"}

(Take our country, just don’t raise taxes.) He fudges the data, slaps a false title on his report, and journalists copy his work like they’re Claudine Gay writing a thesis. Thus, in its story on the murder of Riley, The New York Times cited “studies” showing “no causal connection” between immigrants and crime. Indeed, the Times said, studies “have concluded” that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens. The article links to 1) Nowrasteh’s sham study and 2) a 2017 Times story that cites Nowrasteh’s sham study. That same day, the Times’ Angelo Fichera ran a “fact check” on Donald Trump’s claim that “the United States is being overrun by the Biden migrant crime. It’s a new form of vicious violation to our country.” Fichera’s ruling: “This lacks evidence.” His proof: “One recently updated analysis by Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, found that the homicide conviction rate for illegal immigrants in Texas in 2015 was slightly lower than the rate among U.S. citizens.” (If they’re so law-abiding, why are they fleeing the crime in countries full of people just like them?) The Nowrasteh “study,” and others that perform the exact same error-ridden analysis, is the heart and soul of the immigrants-commit-less-crime scam. If it’s wrong, liberals have nothing, and you can go back to believing your lying eyes. Needless to say, his study is not merely off by a homicidal illegal or two. He — and others like him — aren’t even comparing illegal aliens to citizens. They’re comparing illegal aliens to a group that includes both illegal aliens and citizens. As I pointed out in “Adios, America!” (and apparently will have to keep pointing out for the rest of my life): Texas’ crime data only counts illegal aliens who have already been caught and fingerprinted by the Department of Homeland Security. That leaves out a lot of illegals. Is the DHS even fingerprinting migrants at the border anymore? If not, then by Nowrasteh’s calculations, illegals’ crime rate in Texas is zero. How about we only count the murder convictions of citizens who’ve previously been fingerprinted by the Denver police? Why would we do that? Obviously, a lot of the inmates originally classified as “other/unknown” will later turn out to be illegals. But all these Nowrasteh counts as “citizens.” He had his headline, so why bother updating the data? According to the more accurate count of illegals in Texas prisons, they commit 30% more murders than U.S. citizens — not to be confused with a “slightly lower” rate than citizens. Not only that, but the longer inmates are in prison, the more of them will be found to be illegals, whereas the reverse is not true. Consequently, the number of illegal alien murderers continues to grow, while the “other/unknown” — all of whom Nowrasteh calls “citizens” — continues to shrink. Why doesn’t the government tell us? The fact that it won’t — and that the media aren’t asking for concrete numbers — tells us more than a million phony studies. Not only the above but all Texas cities do NOT all report every illegal criminal to ICE or record convictions."}

They say it’s now operating in the United States. The scale of its operations is unknown, but crimes attributed to alleged members of the gang have worried elected officials and some Republican members of Congress have asked the Biden administration “to formally designate the vicious Tren de Aragua as a Transnational Criminal Organization.” For several years, the criminal group has terrorized South American countries, including Venezuela, its country of origin, as well as Bolivia, Colombia, Chile and Peru.

Very active on the Searcy High School soccer team, and now he’s possibly going to be paralyzed.” Police arrested 45-year-old Candelario Gameros-Ante on Saturday. According to authorities, Gameros-Ante admitted to opening fire on Isaiah Toledo while he was driving home from a graduation party. \"He was within a half mile or so from his house and this suspect just opened fire on his car,\" Hernandez said. What investigators uncovered next added another layer of shock. Hernandez said Gameros-Ante had been living in the United States under a false identity. “Mr. Gomez actually had a legit Arkansas driver’s license with that name,” Hernandez said. “He stole a Social Security card and used that to get the license—with his photo on it. He was deported back in 2017 and came back under this false identity.” Officers also took two other individuals into custody at Gameros-Ante’s residence. “They were also wanted by ICE,” Hernandez said. “They are now being detained with ICE holds. And I would imagine Mr. Gomez is probably going to be, if not already, with an ICE hold.” Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a statement about the shooting in a post on X."}

I’m focused on the current.” snip Ms. Welker asked Mr. Trump whether he had been presented with plans, and he said that he had not — but added that there were “methods which you could do it.” Ms. Welker suggested one possibility: having Vice President JD Vance at the top of the ticket in 2028, only to pass the office on to Mr. Trump after winning. Mr. Trump acknowledged “that’s one” way it could happen. “But there are others too,” he said. “There are others.” Mr. Trump declined to say what those could be."}

It is a governmental structure which encourages discord. Businesses can operate only if they follow the same religious principles. Unique individuals each have their own unique faith. A theocracy alters fundamental religious beliefs. It is selfish. Facts are ignored if they don’t agree with the holy book. A theocratic government may also limit the expression of dissenting opinions or critical thinking that goes against religious beliefs, and religious figures who are in power in a theocracy may be immune to criticism or challenge from their constituents Click to expand... agree. however when the Lord returns, many of the cons will melt away. here is the rest of the article you cited..... 12 Theocracy Pros and Cons​ June 6, 2017 by Louise Gaille A theocracy is a government which features a religious person, being, or idea as the highest ruler within its structures. The population might elect a President, but the President would be viewed as required to report to a god. This type of structure tends to support the majority position within the country and allow for less overall societal conflict within that majority because everyone believes something similar. A theocracy can also create discord because it is directly tied to religious beliefs. If someone disagrees with what the government is doing, their own religious ideas or freedoms can be placed at-risk. Here are more pros and cons of a theocracy to consider. What Are the Pros of a Theocracy?​ 1. It operates efficiently. A theocracy keeps people united under one large umbrella. Because faith is directly tied into government operations, there are fewer delays in the implementation of operational policies. There is rarely an opportunity for debate when new policies are implemented or current policies are changed. The government decrees what needs to be accomplished. Religious institutions then implement this decree from the pulpit, classroom, or other location of influence. 2. Law enforcement efforts are streamlined. In the United States, there are four basic levels of government: local, county, state, and national. Each has its own form of law enforcement. A community has police officers. Counties operate with a Sheriff’s or Marshall’s office. State law enforcement also exists. A national-level law enforcement entity would be like the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. In the US, there are dozens of national-level government agencies that employ full-time officers who can make an arrest. Within a theocracy, this would become a centralized structure instead of having each be independent of one another. 3. It is a form of government which has higher levels of societal compliance. Arguably, the greatest fear that humans have is of the unknown. There is nothing scarier, therefore, than what will happen to someone after they die. The hope that a religion offers for what happens after death can help to take that fear away, which is how compliance throughout a society is generated within this type of government. If a person’s salvation is threatened because they won’t comply with the government, a faithful person may choose to comply to limit their risks of eternal damnation. 4. A theocracy could do amazing things for people in need. If a theocracy were to follow the edicts of their holy books to the letter, it could change the world in several incredible ways. Hunger could be eliminated because neighbors would share with neighbors. Everyone could have access to proper health care. No one would be living in poverty unless they consciously chose to do so. There would be more helping hands available to those in need. 5. There is no longer a need to find a compromise. Because the majority is already on the same page for governmental policies and procedures, there is less time spent trying to find a compromise between ideas. Even if there is a “conflict” between two groups, the supreme overseeing the government would have the final say. People would come together, pray or worship, and come away with a common goal. 12 Theocracy Pros and Cons A theocracy is a government which features a religious person, being, or idea as the vittana.org"}

You show more respect to a YouTuber that sells t-shirts in your posts than the Vice President of the United States, why is that? Click to expand... good observation Bird, yes i show more respect and love toward Crystal than Carmel for many reasons. here are a few of them.... Carmel Would ‘Eliminate Religious Freedom,’ Has ‘Extreme’ Anti-Catholic Agenda: Catholic Leaders ​ Carmel, who was ranked the most liberal senator in the US, has an ‘extremist’ pro-abortion, pro-LGBT record and would likely ‘persecute’ Catholics, as the Biden-Harris administration has already done, Michael Hichborn and other Catholics leaders warned. Carmel presidency would be a threat to the religious freedoms of Catholics and the lives of preborn babies , Catholics leaders are warning. Bird, since i am a christian and pro-life, then i have nothing to do with Carmel. even the Orange is not solid pro-life but not as radical. Similarly, Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DOJ released a memo suggesting that concerned parents and advocates who opposed racial identity politics and sexual ideology in the classroom were akin to domestic terrorists. and we want that crew for 4 more years? The Biden-Harris administration also tried to force hospitals and doctors , including Catholic ones, to facilitate the surgical and genital mutilation of gender-confused individuals and to commit abortions. But apart from that, Harris also has a record of targeting pro-lifers and Catholics . For example, as attorney general of California, she targeted Catholic pro-life journalist David Daleiden after he released videos that showed Planned Parenthood executives casually discussing the sale of aborted baby body parts. She also supported a bill, later thrown out by the Supreme Court, that would force pro-life pregnancy centers to tell women where they can obtain abortions. again, nothing good going on here. and yes i abhor genital mutilation; God made us male and female. “For Harris to show that she holds no animosity toward Catholics, Christians, or even social conservatives, Harris would have to denounce the majority of her political career and completely reject and apologize for her bigoted comments,” he said. But this would mean the vice president would need to “completely abandon her radical agenda against human life, the nuclear family, and religious freedom.” Carmel is the enemy of the usa and christians, prolly not going to change by november. “As someone who has watched Harris over the years, including her legal attempt to crush David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress, I can say from firsthand experience that Harris detests truth, beginning of course with Christ and His Word, not to mention her revilement at preborn babies and their defenders,” American Life League president Judy Brown told LifeSiteNews in a media statement. “Harris has never stood for morality, ethics or truth.” https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinio...c-agenda-catholic-leaders/?utm_source=popular there is a lot more to say concerning Carmel, but a few points will suffice this morning. eventually she will meet her doom, it is best to keep her out of politics and throw all the Criminals in dee cee out. ."}

WW three is not a new idea, Wiki says Time mag talked about it in the 40's. maybe it's time we take it seriously.... Time magazine was an early adopter, if not originator, of the term \"World War III\". The first usage appears in its 3 November 1941 issue (preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941) under its \"National Affairs\" section and entitled \"World War III?\" about Nazi refugee Hermann Rauschning , who had just arrived in the United States. [3] In its 22 March 1943, issue under its \"Foreign News\" section, Time reused the same title \"World War III?\" about statements by then- US Vice President Henry A. Wallace : \"We shall decide sometime in 1943 or 1944 ... whether to plant the seeds of World War III.\" [4] [5] Time continued to entitle with or mention in stories the term \"World War III\" for the rest of the decade and onwards: 1944, [6] [7] 1945, [8] [9] 1946 (\"bacterial warfare\"), [10] 1947, [11] and 1948. [12] Time persists in using this term, for example, in a 2015 book review entitled \"This Is What World War III Will Look Like\".

Netanyahu, obviously did the opposite! i24NEWS www.i24news.tv Perhaps, grandstanding and using him to polish Harris' image had only made matters worse.

Would Netanyahu go with the ceasefire to look like that he's being cowed by Harris? Did Harris' public announcement of her pressure on Netanyahu, ENCOURAGED Hezbollah to attack Israel? I think so! Lol - back-to-back assassination! Killing Iran's puppet - in Iran! - who heads the negotiations for Hamas? Does that looks like anywhere like a ceasefire to you folks?

If Harris really wants a ceasefire, and is truly trying to help the people of Gaza...................she shouldn't have made it public that she's put the pressure on Netanyahu! Since the fate of Gazans are on the line here - if you truly want their sufferings to end - she should've done this more delicately. You don't shame a nation's leader - especially one who's engaged in a bitter war - and make it look like you can dictate to him. Not PUBLICLY , anyway.

Mike Pence would have been a terrible President. But he had humility, and to judge him by this actions he was a good Vice President. Kamala Harris might choose someone with religious \"credentials\" in the sure knowledge that they will never be President. If it made sense to Trump, to choose someone from Indiana (an unloseable state) just to bolster up the religious vote, then surely it now makes sense for Harris to choose someone who is overtly religious? Her own religious background is questionable. It's entirely predictable that Americans who don't really care about religion, will attack Harris for not being a \"real christian.\" They will paint her as a Hindu, not because of any animus towards Hindus, but just to damage her with Christian voters. A full blood Christian as her VP, would weaken and defeat such attacks."}

She had been orphaned at an early age, and had gone to work as a seamstress aged fourteen. But in 1810, aged 19, she felt compelled to go into a chapel service in Great Yarmouth. That morning she heard a preacher expound 2 Corinthians 5:11 : ‘Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others.’ Sarah was converted. She soon was able to testify: I wished to give proof of my love, and desired the Lord to open privileges to me of serving my fellow creatures, that happily I might, with the Bible in my hand, point others to those fountains of joy, whence my own so largely flowed.[23] She continued to work long hours as a dressmaker. But she devoted every other waking hour to serving others: visiting those in the nearby workhouse hospital; providing schooling to poor workhouse children; teaching factory girls. When she was 27 she began visiting prisoners in the Tolhouse Gaol in Great Yarmouth. Conditions were among the worst in the country. Men and women indiscriminately were crammed into two vile underground dungeons infested with rats and lice. At first, Sarah read the Bible to prisoners. She then organised Sunday Services, began literacy classes, and introduced schemes for paid work. Eventually the town authorities were so delighted with improved conditions in the prison, and declining reoffending rates in the town, that they paid her to work full time with the prisoners. Her health broke down as a result of all her work. She died in 1843 aged 52.[24] Sarah Martin was just one of tens of thousands of Christians during the 19th century in England who expected to devote significant amounts of time in voluntary service to those more needy than themselves. It was the expectation that genuine Christians would be engaged in active benevolence: taken for granted just as much as we might expect a real believer to engage in prayer and Bible reading. Christian Compassion Today In the UK We can be tempted to be gloomy about the situation for Christians here in the UK. But we should be thankful to God for all those who are daily showing mercy and compassion in their own communities. Since 1960 evangelicals have formed as many charitable and philanthropic organisations as had been established in the golden age of evangelical influence in the 19th century.[25] A 2003 Home Office Citizenship Survey calculated that a quarter of regular churchgoers, or around a million people, are involved in voluntary community service outside the church, concluding that people who follow a religion were significantly more likely to formally volunteer.[26] The 2005 report, Faith in England’s Northwest, estimated that volunteers contributed around 8.1 million volunteer hours each year, (the equivalent of 4,815 full-time jobs), with the annual financial value of this contribution being between £61 and £65 million. Another study, Faith in the East of England, recorded a similarly wide range of activities supported by worshipping communities, from the ‘traditional’ such as visiting the sick (80 per cent of faith groups do this) and running lunch clubs (36 per cent) to the more innovative such as IT training (7 per cent). The report estimated that the value of faith community volunteer work to the region was around £30 million a year. In 2006 a UK survey found that Christians give 7.5 times as much as others of their salary to charity/church/good causes.[27] Continued below:"}

All religions aim to replace one sinner self with a collective, group thinking machine. That is what makes religions and governments do to war to spread its hate. They want to force others to give up their inner self and replace it with someone else's thoughts. That is a violent attack on free thinking humans. The existence of humans who can think for themselves threatens Christians, making Christians vote for vile scum like Trump and Vance. Some Christians have even asserted that Trump is the second coming of Christ. The guy that lies, cheats, steals, insults, uses people, kills and does not respect law is mirroring the worst of authoritarian rule is the face of Christianity in the US right now. That is what Christianity is in the US. And here you are projecting some bullshit about what myself/lifestyle you think I have. Click to expand... My are you so touchy..? I'm simply telling you that the Christians I have met generally are content and are not sad even if they have issues. (As you said) They take every day as it comes and have hope for a very joyous future. Your opinion of OUR President and Vice President reveals both what you value and hate. And none of that impresses me as one holding to having a love for the nation of Israel. I will say that I voted along biblical considerations that do not include legalized abortion nor Sodomy. I see Trump as a human who is not afraid to make unpopular decisions that move our nation back to being a Republic and away from Socialism. People who come into this country illegally are not entitled to welfare, and people who wish to be something they aren't are free to do as they please, but should never demand that others agree with their choices ------ freedom goes both ways. PS. As a Christian, I believe I'm a free thinker whether you would agree or not. John 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."}

Dr Katie Pruszynski, a Trump specialist and researcher at the University of Sheffield, said the theory isn’t new. ‘This is a very clear example of how fringe figures such as Curtis Yarvin are transformed from a fairly nondescript computer scientist into a political philosopher through social media,’ she said. ‘Yarvin has no expertise on democratic or political theory, but is well read in libertarian and far-right literature and was merely a blogger until his views began being shared more widely in alt-right corners of the internet. ‘His embrace by Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaires such as Peter Thiel has propelled him to the centre of the far-right’s political intelligensia. ‘But his views are not new, and the actions being taken by the Trump administration to hollow out the administrative state do not originate with Yarvin, despite bearing many of the same neo-reactionary hallmarks.’ Dr Pruszynski said Yarvin, among others, ‘is riding the wave of attention those ideas are now drawing’. She said: ‘His views on technocracies and the desirability of an authoritarian state are extreme but were made more mainstream by Trump Republicans some time ago, which is far more troubling.’ MSN www.msn.com Blessings all, Bible prophecy marches on. where are you marching today ?"}

Time magazine was an early adopter, if not originator, of the term \"World War III\".

[3] In its 22 March 1943, issue under its \"Foreign News\" section, Time reused the same title \"World War III?\" about statements by then- US Vice President Henry A. Wallace : \"We shall decide sometime in 1943 or 1944 ... whether to plant the seeds of World War III.\" [4] [5] Time continued to entitle with or mention in stories the term \"World War III\" for the rest of the decade and onwards: 1944, [6] [7] 1945, [8] [9] 1946 (\"bacterial warfare\"), [10] 1947, [11] and 1948. [12] Time persists in using this term, for example, in a 2015 book review entitled \"This Is What World War III Will Look Like\". [13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III"}

The Charlotte Lozier Institute is an anti-abortion think tank dedicated to making abortion illegal and inaccessible. It is not a neutral organization and it publishes false statements about women, pregnancy, abortion and stem cell research. Charles “Chuck” Donovan is the president of CLI. He is an anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ extremist with an extensive history working alongside right-wing organizations like the Family Research Council, which was labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He was formerly a research fellow at the right wing Heritage Foundation. He has falsely claimed that cutting Planned Parenthood funding “will benefit American women and their children”; he has also claimed on behalf of rape survivors that rape is rarely a reason why women seek abortions later in pregnancy. Donovan has said proponents of the Defense of Marriage Act were incorrectly labeled irrational bigots. The CLI president has also claimed that marriage equality would weaken civil society and the freedom it guarantees. David Prentice is vice president and research director of CLI. Prentice is an anti-abortion biochemist who has used his work in the field to advocate against research using stem cells and fetal tissue. In 2018, after failing to adequately disclose his ties to CLI, he testified before Congress that “ample scientific alternatives [to fetal tissue research] exist” and that such research is no longer needed — claims which notable scientists have sharply denied, including a researcher whose work Prentice cited to prove his point. Tara Sander Lee is an associate scholar at CLI. She is vehemently opposed to research using fetal tissue due to her anti-abortion and religious beliefs. She has written that “life begins at the moment of conception and that we are created by a sovereign god, so using human embryos or fetuses as objects and means of experimentation constitutes an assault against their dignity as human beings created by god.” In her 2018 congressional testimony on fetal tissue alternatives, she spread blatant misinformation. Sander Lee claimed “very little research being done” that relies on fetal tissue when in reality, NIH scientists have said that lifesaving research depends on it.

In this context the Greek word rendered “world” does not refer to the planet Earth. Rather, it refers to humankind. Hence, Paul is saying that from the moment humans were created, they could see evidence of the Creator’s qualities in the things he made. That evidence is all around us. It is not hidden in nature but is “clearly seen.” From the largest to the smallest, creation clearly reveals not only that there is a Creator but also that he has wonderful qualities. Does not the intelligent design so obvious in nature reveal to us God’s wisdom? Do not the starry heavens and the pounding surf reveal his power? Does not the variety of foods that delight our palate and the beauty of sunrises and sunsets reveal his love for mankind?— Psalm 104:24; Isaiah 40:26 . How plain is the evidence? It is so clear that those who do not see it and who thus refuse to believe in God “are inexcusable.” One scholar illustrates it this way: Imagine a driver who ignores a sign that says “Detour—Turn Left.” A police officer stops him and starts writing him a ticket. The driver tries to argue that he did not see the sign. But his words carry little weight because the sign is in plain view and there is nothing wrong with the driver’s vision. Besides, as a driver, the responsibility for seeing and heeding such signs is his. So it is with the evidence of God in nature. That “sign” is in plain view. As reasoning creatures, we are capable of seeing it. There is no excuse for ignoring it. The Bible also speaks of “the world” as being guilty of sin and needing a savior, clearly showing that in such contexts the term applies to humankind and not the earth.— John 1:29; 4:42; 12:47 . The Creator left his imprint on his handiwork https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2013564?q=no+excuse&p=sen"}

Chris Ramsay (@chrisramsay52) will be doing a deep dive on this autopsy on Area52 in a couple of weeks. 1) The UFO Crash and Flight Path In January 1996, a large metallic, cigar-shaped object was tracked moving low over Minas Gerais, Brazil. Farmers, civilians, and a trained ultralight pilot independently described the same craft: silent, distressed, leaking white vapor, with a visible tear in its hull. The object ultimately crashed near Varginha, leaving a debris field spanning over a football field. 2) The Beings Multiple witnesses reported seeing up to three small beings emerge from the crash site. They were described consistently: short stature, large heads, almond-shaped red eyes, ridged foreheads, thin limbs, and a strong ammonia or sulfur smell that lingered for days. They were injured and fearful. 3) The Girls’ Encounter Three young women encountered one of the beings in an urban neighborhood just blocks from where a military capture later occurred. One of them, Katia, locked eyes with the being and described a silent plea for help. All three maintained their accounts for nearly three decades despite ridicule, intimidation, and literal attempts to pay them to recant. 4) Military Capture Brazilian military police officers Marco Chereze and Erico Lopes reportedly captured a living being with their bare hands and transported it in a vehicle. Lopes later threatened Fox’s crew when confronted, preemptively referencing “the ET” before being asked anything, a moment Fox describes as a tacit admission. 5) Hospitalization and Medical Testimony A senior neurosurgeon and hospital director at Humanitas Regional Hospital testified on camera that he was face-to-face with a living non-human entity for several minutes in the ICU. He described direct telepathic communication, overwhelming intelligence, and a sense of compassion from the being. He came forward only after surviving a heart attack and cancer, stating he could no longer take the truth to the grave. 6) The Death of a Soldier Officer Marco Chereze died weeks after the capture from a rare, aggressive infection. Forensic pathologists involved in the autopsy stated the bacteria behaved unlike any known terrestrial organism. They speculate the infection entered through a small scratch, possibly from the being itself. The autopsy report was initially withheld from Chereze’s family. 7) Men in Black Witnesses across the case reported intimidation by unidentified men in unmarked vehicles who knew intimate details about their lives and families and demanded silence. Similar patterns appear in cases worldwide, from Phoenix Lights to Rendlesham Forest to Calvine, suggesting a coordinated, rapid-response suppression apparatus operating beyond normal jurisdiction. 8) Corroboration Across Decades Fox connects Varginha to a global pattern: crashed craft, recovered beings, confiscated evidence, and witnesses silenced under threat. The consistency spans cultures, decades, and political systems, undermining claims of hoax or mass hysteria. 9) Why This Case Matters Varginha is not a single witness story. It involves civilians, doctors, military personnel, forensic reports, physical traces, and a clear timeline. If judged as a court case, Fox argues, the evidentiary threshold would already be met. If you want the most comprehensive, human, and unsettling account of a modern UFO crash with alleged living occupants, this episode documents it in full. And if you want the FULL STORY go watch James’ amazing, world-changing documentary - Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters. James' just broke the most important, corroborated and intense UFO crash in modern history."}

The test that the German command set up was a hill climbing test where the two tanks went head to head climbing a steep sand dune. The Panzer's superior power-to-weight ratio and wider treads allowed the Panzer to easily navigate the dune, while the Sherman lower power and narrower tracks had it failing over and over and sliding back down the hill, to the laughter and jeers of the German command. They left with an over inflated impression of the Panzer superiority, while the engineering crews knew the truth of it. What they knew, and what the command ignored, was that the Sherman drove the hundreds of miles across rough desert terrain from the front to the testing ground under its own power, something the engineers knew the Panzer was not capable of doing. Click to expand... Indeed and what's great about this thread and topic and that commands me into it is the nitty gritty of gears and the machines that operate on 'em and how the capability of the machines challenge the wits of the commanders who must apply them to the tactics, operations and strategies that are decisive to winning the war -- which for the US and Allies is how it happened. Your instance above of the two tanks of warring forces taking on a hill in a test case highlights how the Germans lost in the Second World War. And how the Americans and Allies won. The German overemphasis on the machinery of tactics was a major factor in the loss while the American keen focus to the machinery of operational endurance and its enabling ability to show up, along with effectiveness, prevailed. The Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy, located at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington D.C., is formerly the U.S. Army Industrial College. Founded in 1924 as the Army Industrial College to compensate for America’s many mobilization shortcomings in World War I, the school would be renamed the Industrial College of the Armed Forces and moved to Fort McNair in 1946, alongside the newly established National War College. Signifying the heightened importance of joint, interservice thinking and operations growing out of World War II, both would become part of the National Defense University when it was established in 1976. Ft. McNair is also the Headquarters of the Military District of Washington DC that contains the secure subterranean sustainment facility where all 535 members of Congress and the Vice President were taken temporarily for their safety and protection on Jan. 6th 2021. Two companies of armed troops from the 3rd Infantry Regiment at Ft. Myer off the upper left of the photo (Jefferson Memorial) were deployed to the Fort until 9 pm which was after the Biden election was certified. In 1939 Germany stumbled into a war it was not ready to wage when it came to natural resources, access to raw materials and their availability, and its ability to sustain its war effort to a successful conclusion no matter how that might have been defined. While geography spared the US from its own version of the aerial Battle of Britain, its position as FDR's Arsenal of Democracy meant it had to devise seagoing delivery tactics, operations, strategies in the Battle of the Atlantic. US Naval commanders had to minimize and overcome massed \"Wolf Pack\" U-Boat attacks that consumed resources of delivery as well as the products that were made possible by the USA War Planning Board that identified and accessed the raw materials that were needed to achieve the final victory in Europe."}

The left is determined to stop deportations while they aren't determined to stop \"regular police\" from responding to burglaries, bar fights, domestic violence, etc. The left's very determined goal is to stop ICE from doing their job - to prevent and stop federal law enforcement. They will (and quite frankly, must) fail at that goal and the chaos they are creating in trying to accomplish that goal will only result in more and completely unnecessary harm. There are plenty of cooperative places in this nation where this deportation process is going smoothly and effectively, just as it can and should. As far as masks, you know as well as I do that these ICE officers are being purposely and deliberately targeted. Clearly, you and all those who are playing the silly game of \"regular police somehow manage without masks\" want those ICE officers to be easily identified so they and their families can be doxxed, threatened, and harmed - just as the left is intent on doing in order to stop deportations or threaten/intimidate those officers from performing their job."}

Kennedy Jr., a person tasked with oversight of federally funded medical and scientific research and the legal authority to respond to public health emergencies , recently proclaimed that we need to “ stop trusting experts .” This comment doesn’t come out of nowhere. It echoes a general distrust of scientific expertise that has grown in recent years, further exacerbated by conspiracy theorists who saw the pandemic as an opportunity to cast doubt on the scientific process and on scientists themselves. As the Associated Press reported in October, distrust of scientific expertise is increasingly being written into legislation across the country , moving it from rhetoric into public policy. And even when decades of progress toward treating and curing cancer are undone by funding cuts , there is little public pushback. Worse still, these efforts won’t even save the government money. Studies have shown that cutting science funding will actually cost the country billions of dollars per year , as well as cutting jobs, delaying medical advances and harming national security. That leads us to an important question: Who are these scientific experts that we should not trust? Do they have a long history of deception and no track record of success that benefits the public? Are they interested only in profit? Do they live in secret volcano lairs, plotting evil takeovers of the country?\" _____ Some people are extremely intuitive, most are not. So, we turn to the experts. When Kennedy says, \"don't trust the experts\", who are we supposed to \"trust\" instead? I'll go with knowledge, evidence and experience, thank you. Click to expand... The media's use of experts? How do get the label of \"expert\"? This is op article from the NYT below. The media’s use of experts is just a tactic to sway your opinion toward a particular point of view. The view in the op being pushed is the shooting was not justified based expert opinion. --------------------- The answer is contingent on many factors, experts said, including the complex interplay of power and jurisdiction among law enforcement agencies. While Ms. Good was compelled to follow a lawful order, it is not clear whether the immigration agents on the scene were acting within their authority. “What were the ICE officers even attempting to do?” asked Rachel Moran, an expert on police accountability at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. “There’s a couple of key questions, I think. One is, were they involved in a legitimate enforcement operation at that point? And the second is, was she actually blocking their vehicles?” All of which makes it difficult to assess the actions of Ms. Good. “There’s so many of these issues that need to be resolved in this global framework before we can get down to the nitty-gritty of, ‘Was it a lawful order?’” said Geoffrey Alpert, an expert on police use of force at the University of South Carolina. Was Renee Good Obligated to Comply With an ICE Agent’s Orders? The agent told Ms. Good to get out of her car before she was fatally shot. Legal experts said immigration agents may sometimes, but not always, have the authority to make such commands. www.nytimes.com"}

Each house of Congress sets its own internal rules of operation protected from interference by the other 2 branches. It's popular to claim there are 3 coequal branches but that's not what's in the Constitution. Click to expand... The three branches of government: different teams, different jobs​ The United States government, and every state government, has three branches with their own unique powers and responsibilities. The legislative branch includes the legislators, usually a large House of Representatives and a smaller Senate . (Nebraska is the only state with just one body of legislators, called the Nebraska Unicameral Legislature.) Legislators are responsible for writing new laws. For example, the legislative branch decides what behavior is illegal, sets tax rates, and writes the rules on how to register to vote in each state. The executive branch is led by a chief executive such as a governor or the U.S. president . The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws passed by the legislative branch. For example, the Attorney General, the chief prosecutor, is responsible for enforcing laws against drug dealing, assault, and even pollution. The executive branch is also responsible for enforcing laws around schools, child protection, safe workplaces, social services, motor vehicles, and so on. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws written by the legislative branch. This includes settling disputes between two people who disagree under the law, as well as overseeing criminal trials. Each state differs a little in how these branches are structured. For example, in New Hampshire an Executive Council – made up of five elected officials – is responsible for approving state contracts and appointments made by the governor. New Hampshire also does not elect any judges, which is rare in the United States. However, the basic role of each branch stays the same. Separation of powers: each team has its own specialty​ The United States and other democracies use the separation of powers so that each branch has a clear role, with limited power. For example, the legislative branch has the “power of the purse,” meaning they have the power to set the state and/or federal budget. The executive branch cannot decide to suddenly spend more on bombs or parks without the legislature’s say-so. Meanwhile the judicial branch can’t call up an army to enforce the laws how they want; only the governor or U.S. president has that power. Checks and balances: each team can limit the others​ While the three branches of government have separate powers, they also have the ability to limit how far the other branches go. This is called a system of checks and balances . For example, the governor or U.S. President has the power to veto any new laws passed by the legislative branch. However, if the legislative branch strongly supports a new law, they can override that veto with a supermajority vote (a threshold higher than 50%). The legislature also has the power to impeach executive branch officials and remove them from office, if there is enough evidence of wrongdoing. The judicial branch has the power to rule that a law violates citizens’ rights or other parts of the constitution. If the judicial branch decides a law is “unconstitutional,” it can no longer be enforced by the executive branch. No one branch is more powerful than the other and that is by design. Three equal branches of government: separation of powers, and checks and balances The United States and many other democracies operate with three equal branches of government: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch has different powers (called the “separation of powers”). A system of checks and balances ensures each branch has... www.citizenscount.org"}

Video of the incident shows an agent kneeling on a woman’s back as she lies face down in the snow. Onlookers descended on the scene, yelling at ICE agents to release the woman, saying she’s pregnant and couldn’t breathe, according to The Associated Press . An agent later dragged her by the arm, as she lay on her back, through the street toward a vehicle. Observers continued to yell, and the agent released her, the AP reported. O’Hara said in a statement to Reuters that the footage of the woman being dragged through the street is “profoundly disturbing.” “This egregious disregard for human dignity is appalling,” he said in the statement. “It is deeply concerning that there appears to be a lack of accountability from our federal partners.” Click to expand... ICE are of course filthy animals. However, there is some good news. Minneapolis police chose to emulate Tucson and provide no aid to ICE when the crowd put a stop to the bullshit. At a news conference on Tuesday, O’Hara said local police were called to the scene by a federal agent who said officers needed help. The police chief said officers arrived and ultimately determined that their assistance was not needed and could have made the situation worse. Click to expand... I would suggest that a better course of action would have been to arrest the ICE agents."}

Judy claims that the photojournalist did not receive any judicial warrant and was arrested directly before being taken to Bluebonnet Detention Facility near Fort Worth. However, his arrest is interesting, given that he has not been taken into custody for breaking immigration law. His lawyers confirmed that his DACA protection is still valid until May 2026. So, why was he arrested? According to Judy, the Trump administration accused Ya’akub of “glorifying terrorism” in their social media posts. According to a court filing from last week, a day before he was arrested, the photojournalist attended a city council meeting in Dallas. He spoke out in support of a community leader, who ICE detained, and he also recorded the whole thing.[ /quote] Click to expand... So now we're arresting journalists for wrongthink.

Veraza said the family was in their car when they heard a helicopter and honking, common signals in the Chicago area these days that federal agents are nearby. They decided to leave. That’s when a masked agent pointed a pepper-spray gun through their vehicle’s open window and fired. A cloudy substance hit Veraza in the face, which also affected his daughter, according to a video taken by the family. Click to expand...

Police said the officer saw a man exit his car while pointing a gun at the female driver behind him. \"The officer immediately stopped to assist, not knowing the identity of the armed male or the circumstances unfolding in front of him,\" Fullerton police said in a statement. According to police, the armed man identified himself as an ICE agent, provided credentials and told the Fullerton officer that the woman had been following and recording him. \"The Fullerton Police Officer informed the agent that he could not assist with someone following or recording him if no crime had occurred, and that local law enforcement (Santa Ana PD) was en route. The female left the area shortly after,\" police said. Fullerton police said its officer left the scene after reiterating to the ICE agent that he would not assist if no crime had occurred. \"ICE is a federal law enforcement agency, and Fullerton Police Officers will assist them, and any other local, state, or federal law enforcement agency, in situations involving immediate officer safety,\" Fullerton police said in a statement. \"However, Senate Bill 54 prohibits local law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement.

Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the Senate as members are sworn in. While the speaker of the House will preside over the swearing in of new members of the House.

Is that what you think this is? I've never heard a swearing-in ceremony referred to as an \"orientation.\" The reason? Senate orientations have nothing to do with swear-ins . Hopefully that link will help end this \"convo.\" If it doesn't, perhaps the fact that Schumer has reversed course and invited candidates still in contested elections to the orientation will."}

Click to expand... Interesting. Seems like a bait question. The right has protected anything and everything related to the 2nd Amendment and have championed those shot down by federal agents claiming that they had those rights as part of protesting...one example of that was LaVoy Finicum. Now...you, as a conservative...are asking if it was a smart thing for the guy who just got shot to bring a firearm to a protest, even knowing he has the right to do so and has a legal permit to carry. The reason why I'm calling this out as a bait question is because even though conservatives like you would champion that guy if he was supporting your agenda...you want to make him stupid for doing it because he doesn't support your agenda. So, even though you aren't advocating for a legal position to prevent folks from being able to have all the rights you have fought for over the years with the 2nd Amendment, you ARE trying to have your cake and eat it too by stating a slippery slope idea that it's stupid to exercise your 2nd Amendment rights by attending a protest to exercise your 1st Amendment rights and are protecting yourself to be able to do so by invoking your 2nd Amendment rights...a stance the right has been advocating for years! Basically, I feel that you are trying come out and say \"DON'T bring a firearm lawfully to a protest when you are protesting something I support\"...which is, technically, something YOU could be called out for infringing on someone's 2nd Amendment rights. Because, if you DO feel that way, YOU have to justify why a citizen SHOULDN'T exercise their 2nd Amendment right when your side has advocated unfettered ownership and use of firearms."}

And yet, they're silent, or worse, saying the guy was stupid to bring his weapon in the first place. You all know who you are. Somebody posted a video of the Black Panthers in Philadelphia legally carrying long guns explicitly to protect the neighborhood and its citizens from ICE violence. That seems consistent with 2A advocates. Here's a situation where a guy was a filming a protest, not brandishing a weapon, and yet ICE crossed the street to confront him, pepper sprayed him, beat him to the ground, discovered and took his legally concealed weapon and THEN shot him as he was lying there. Let me repeat that. They shot him while he was blinded by pepper spray, on the ground, and disarmed. It absolutely mystifies me that anyone, especially 2A advocates, could assign any blame at all to him, or question why someone might bring a weapon to a protest where ICE agents kill people."}

Now...you, as a conservative...are asking if it was a smart thing for the guy who just got shot to bring a firearm to a protest, even knowing he has the right to do so and has a legal permit to carry. The reason why I'm calling this out as a bait question is because even though conservatives like you would champion that guy if he was supporting your agenda...you want to make him stupid for doing it because he doesn't support your agenda. So, even though you aren't advocating for a legal position to prevent folks from being able to have all the rights you have fought for over the years with the 2nd Amendment, you ARE trying to have your cake and eat it too by stating a slippery slope idea that it's stupid to exercise your 2nd Amendment rights by attending a protest to exercise your 1st Amendment rights and are protecting yourself to be able to do so by invoking your 2nd Amendment rights...a stance the right has been advocating for years! Basically, I feel that you are trying come out and say \"DON'T bring a firearm lawfully to a protest when you are protesting something I support\"...which is, technically, something YOU could be called out for infringing on someone's 2nd Amendment rights. Because, if you DO feel that way, YOU have to justify why a citizen SHOULDN'T exercise their 2nd Amendment right when your side has advocated unfettered ownership and use of firearms.

Master Debator said: I'm fine with your soft side admitting you felt danger from a man helping up a woman. Love that for you. Click to expand... Anyone fool enough to get into a police situation as Pretti did must reap the consequences of his own foolishness. He may have felt invulnerable after he wasn't arrested the previous week for assaulting an ICE vehicle. Master Debator said: The cameras were there because they knew ICE was behaving dangerously and irresponsibly. They were there to shine a light on it. The had the appropriate amount of patriotism to liberty and limited government. Click to expand... Once they interfered directly in operations, rather than staying clear and filming, they caused the entire situation. Master Debator said: What did I say about you that was false? I didn't tell you tell us that you would of felt danger from a man helping a woman off the ground. Who needs to make up anything about you when you're going to come here and reveal shit like that yourself? Click to expand... I corrected your false impression that you were dominant in this argument. That's the funniest fanfic I've read from you yet. Master Debator said: Sure you do. You know everything about me. That's a real thing you can know and not at all make believe..... Click to expand... Nothing make believe about crazy ICE protesters ramming their cars into ICE vehicles 60 times in the last year. Ah, spoils your vision of saintly protesters, don't it?"}

You know, I think the real reason Minnesotans are so insane about the ICE incursions-- which they have been for months before the two shootings-- is because they're deeply embarrassed that their politicians encouraged a major swindling operation and tamped down whistleblowers. All of that makes every MN citizen look extremely stupid, and so when ICE comes in to look for criminals, some of whom participated in the fraud, Minnesotans become aggrieved and start ranting about horrible ICE tactics. But up until recently, none of them would countenance having local cops coordinate with the federal ones, because that would mean cooperating with \"Nazis.\" Pretti didn't go to the site of an ICE operation by accident, he either going to interfere with the operation or was hoping to catch the agents on film doing bad stuff. We'll never know which he had in mind. You want everyone to be horrified that an agent pushed one of the protesters to the ground, as if that wasn't candy-ass treatment after all the things MN protesters have been doing. Last I looked, being pushed to the ground isn't fun but it's not fatal. When Pretti inserted himself in the quarrel, he made himself a target, because a cop can't be sure that anyone so interfering is just naive or is actually planning an attack. Even so he'd probably be alive but for his foolish decision to go armed when interacting with cops doing their job, in a milieu in which the protesters had turned the city into a powderkeg. Trump words things badly a lot of times, but I highly doubt he meant that the 2A didn't exist-- which would make him a Liberal, after all. Still nowhere as bad as Harris claiming the border was secure when it wasn't. Click to expand... Of course Trump isn't going to say the 2A doesn't exist, and he didn't. But he and at least one other person said that having a legal firearm on your person justifies the police shooting you. Which, if true, means the 2A effectively does not exist."}

Click to expand... I want you to remember what you just said SavannahMann said: Thugs break into homes. They kick the doors in or force entry, and abuse or kidnap people inside. Police must have a warrant before they enter. You see, Police are restricted by the 4th Amendment. Thugs are criminals, and don't need paperwork or authorization from a Judge. DHS has the policy that they do not need a Judicial Warrant to enter a home or residence. If they are not following the law, clearly established law I might add, then they are breaking the law. Who breaks laws? Criminals. So Thugs one, cops zero. Cops need to justify use of force. Even Less than Lethal uses of force. This includes the use of chemical agents like tear gas, or pepper spray. The cop has to write a report and have that action evaluated. Body Camera footage is often used to decide if the force utilized was justified. Who doesn't have to do that? Who doesn't check with someone if the force is authorized? Who just walks up and assaults people in such a way? Thugs or cops? A few years ago the RW was up in arms when people were playing the \"knock out game\" by just hitting people going about their day. Now, ICE sees someone recording and they begin with spraying the pepper spray and pushing, and hitting people. No justification. No situation where force is authorized. Just violence. That isn't what cops do. That is what thugs do. Shall we continue? We seem to be checking a lot of boxes here. Okay, let's continue. Arrests. Normally police have a reason to arrest someone. If they pick them up they have charges in mind. If your local cop broke down your neighbors door, and dragged the guy out of the house without a warrant to search or an arrest warrant for that guy, the cop would be fired, and the department would be trying to minimize the lawsuit by prosecuting the cop for abuse of office as well as breaking and entering. Police wear badge numbers, and other identifying information. This is so that the officer can point to himself in video and say that was me and I saw this suspect do that. It also establishes the authority that goes with the police. Cops who approach your window say something like. \"I am Officer John Smith of the Brookhaven Police Department. My body camera is on to record this interaction for your protection. May I see your license and registration please?\" Identifying himself, his department, and notifying you that his body camera is on and recording. Polite and respectful. I am this person, I am a police officer, and I am doing this as part of my job. The cop will establish the reason for the interaction. You were speeding. You failed to come to a complete stop. You have a taillight out. Some action that justifies the interaction. The Courts have insisted that the cops have a reason. ICE starts out hostile, and goes downhill from there. Someone must have told them they must establish dominance. But all they are really doing is acting like thugs. No identification is shown. Not even an internal number that can be revealed to be a specific agent as a result of a subpoena. Cops take people to jail to be processed into the Criminal Justice System. The accused is allowed to contact a lawyer. Sixth Amendment if you haven't heard of it. ICE and DHS bounce people all over the nation to keep the people from talking to lawyers. In fact, the more enthusiastic your lawyer is to reach you, the more you're moved around and treated badly so you will \"self deport\". That isn't the action of a cop or a law enforcement agency. That is the behavior of thugs. If a cop lies under oath or on his reports. He is at a minimum put on a Brady List, meaning that the Defense is told that this officer or agent has been found to be less than totally truthful in the past. ICE doesn't do that. They give those who lie bonus checks for good numbers. So the idea that you can't be both is now utterly destroyed. At least if you are remotely honest. Click to expand... How many tens of thousands did ICE interact with in Minneapolis this week ? Give me a number - 100,000 ? 200,000? Nationwide how many did ICE interact with in the last 2 weeks? 1-2 million ? And how many situations went south and ended up in violence? Its very rare for an ICE operations to go south - and really it happens only when left liberal protestors get involved or when the illegally here people get violent Right ?"}

You didn't notice that the Trump Administration spent the weekend and early part of this week arguing that the gun was the problem, and people have no right to carry a gun and two whole magazines of ammunition? Those damned Liberal Trump Administration people! You say in almost every instance the death was warranted. That's an unusual way of looking at it. Warranted. Most people would say that a police officer taking a life might be necessary if regrettable. Few would say warranted. Especially when the absence of warrants is one of the issues with DHS/ICE/CBP activities around the nation. But let's discuss those incidents shall we? First, we ask the cop why he did it. We being society through the investigative process that follows any taking of a life. The cop tells his story. What he did, and why. Evidence is examined, and any video record is examined to check the story. Is the cop telling the truth? If the cop isn't, then he faces criminal charges. Why? The same reason you would if you shot someone and lied about the circumstances. Because killing someone is pretty extreme and the cop, or you, or anyone who does it better have a god damned good reason for doing it. Just as you admit the child wasn't the one initiating the abuse, Pettit didn't initiate the assault either. He moved to stand before a woman who was being abused. He moved to defend another who was being assaulted. He didn't do so with violence. He stood with his hands up holding not a gun, or pepper spray, or anything hostile except a phone he was using to record. He was shoved, and sprayed and assaulted. He didn't swing at the agent. He didn't pull a gun and start shooting. Even when he was being tackled and sprayed while he lay on the ground with five agents on top of him, he did not reach for his weapon. Agents took his weapon, and then shot him. They disarmed him and then executed him. Then they spent days lying about it in the face of clear evidence that their claims were not true. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and they were still lying. When we knew Saturday night they had taken the gun off of him they were still claiming he was armed and assaulting the agents. Sunday they claimed he had gone to kill all those agents. Obvious really since he had a gun. It was Wednesday before they quietly announced the agents involved were now, five days later, placed on administrative leave while they investigate. FIVE DAYS of lying about it. FIVE DAYS of obstructing the investigation from the Cops in the State, County, and City. Even now, they are still conducting the investigation in house. Because they are so honest and trustworthy right?"}

Please explain why 23% of ICE officers are necessary to be in a state that has less then 1% of America's illegal residents.... Hopefully you agree with me that makes NO sense. But maybe you have some wisdom here I am not seeing. Bear in mind, we are not having ICE issues in Florida, Texas and California, collectively the home to 42% of illegal residents. It seems to me that this \"flooding the zone\" strategy is the root of our problems. I trust most sober thinking people see this as WAAYYY too many ICE agents chasing WAAYYY too few illegal residents. Through in the idiotic quota they must meet and this bound to result in ... well, violence and wrongful death. I don't know about you, but if I have a goofy quota to make, then I am going to Florida, Texas or California were the fishing is good.... not to Minnesota where there isn't much in the way of fish. This, of course, assumes that ICE in Minnesota is really about immigation enforcement. Unfortuately sober-minded and aware people do not buy this lie, which is why most of Minneapolis took to the streets last week."}

Those damned Liberal Trump Administration people! Click to expand... link please SavannahMann said: You say in almost every instance the death was warranted. That's an unusual way of looking at it. Warranted. Most people would say that a police officer taking a life might be necessary if regrettable. Few would say warranted. Especially when the absence of warrants is one of the issues with DHS/ICE/CBP activities around the nation. But let's discuss those incidents shall we? First, we ask the cop why he did it. We being society through the investigative process that follows any taking of a life. The cop tells his story. What he did, and why. Evidence is examined, and any video record is examined to check the story. Is the cop telling the truth? If the cop isn't, then he faces criminal charges. Why? The same reason you would if you shot someone and lied about the circumstances. Because killing someone is pretty extreme and the cop, or you, or anyone who does it better have a god damned good reason for doing it. Click to expand... I support investigations deep into both - and remember, both Good and Pretti I have said all along I don't think they should have shot. I understand maybe why it all happened .... but as it happened in both and as I see it? I don't think the defense wants me on the jury SavannahMann said: Just as you admit the child wasn't the one initiating the abuse, Pettit didn't initiate the assault either. Click to expand... I disagree, he injected himself into a Federal agent's situation - he's been known to do that, did you see the other videos on him in previous weeks? SavannahMann said: He moved to stand before a woman who was being abused. Click to expand... oh stop it - she was an agitator too, an instigator and getting in the way of a federal operation. but you literally said he didn't initiate and now you're saying he did SavannahMann said: He moved to defend another who was being assaulted. Click to expand... no, it was a situation with armed federal agents in a very volatile environment and Pretti knew he had a loaded gun and extra mags and he KNEW if Federal agents saw that gun they'd absolutely freak out anyone carrying a concealed gun knows this - I'd think any non-gun owner would too SavannahMann said: He didn't do so with violence. He stood with his hands up holding not a gun, or pepper spray, or anything hostile except a phone he was using to record. He was shoved, and sprayed and assaulted. He didn't swing at the agent. He didn't pull a gun and start shooting. Even when he was being tackled and sprayed while he lay on the ground with five agents on top of him, he did not reach for his weapon. Agents took his weapon, and then shot him. They disarmed him and then executed him. Then they spent days lying about it in the face of clear evidence that their claims were not true. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and they were still lying. When we knew Saturday night they had taken the gun off of him they were still claiming he was armed and assaulting the agents. Sunday they claimed he had gone to kill all those agents. Obvious really since he had a gun. It was Wednesday before they quietly announced the agents involved were now, five days later, placed on administrative leave while they investigate. FIVE DAYS of lying about it. FIVE DAYS of obstructing the investigation from the Cops in the State, County, and City. Even now, they are still conducting the investigation in house. Because they are so honest and trustworthy right? Click to expand... I'm sorry Pretti did what he did that day, I am. I wish the situation would have went different."}

Anderson Cooper asked her this question. \"Did it seem to you, at that moment, that the agents were angry, were emotional?\" She responded, \"I think they rested in a calm anger, which is terrifying. I think because of the protections they have been given to them, I don't think they have a reason to feel anything but confident about what they're doing, and that this is some type of video game.

It seems like Pretti is on top of her for a bit, and then when the officers start pulling him back out into the street, he doesn't relinquish a grip on her. At one point the officers are pulling both Pretti and her, because he has hold of her collar. It looks like another officer breaks Pretti's grip then, and starts pulling the woman back to the safety of the sidewalk."}

It is true that it is my opinion, however it is based upon their actions. Let's take a moment to examine the question. Thugs break into homes. They kick the doors in or force entry, and abuse or kidnap people inside. Police must have a warrant before they enter. You see, Police are restricted by the 4th Amendment. Thugs are criminals, and don't need paperwork or authorization from a Judge. DHS has the policy that they do not need a Judicial Warrant to enter a home or residence. If they are not following the law, clearly established law I might add, then they are breaking the law. Who breaks laws? Criminals. So Thugs one, cops zero. Cops need to justify use of force. Even Less than Lethal uses of force. This includes the use of chemical agents like tear gas, or pepper spray. The cop has to write a report and have that action evaluated. Body Camera footage is often used to decide if the force utilized was justified. Who doesn't have to do that? Who doesn't check with someone if the force is authorized? Who just walks up and assaults people in such a way? Thugs or cops? A few years ago the RW was up in arms when people were playing the \"knock out game\" by just hitting people going about their day. Now, ICE sees someone recording and they begin with spraying the pepper spray and pushing, and hitting people. No justification. No situation where force is authorized. Just violence. That isn't what cops do. That is what thugs do. Shall we continue? We seem to be checking a lot of boxes here. Okay, let's continue. Arrests. Normally police have a reason to arrest someone. If they pick them up they have charges in mind. If your local cop broke down your neighbors door, and dragged the guy out of the house without a warrant to search or an arrest warrant for that guy, the cop would be fired, and the department would be trying to minimize the lawsuit by prosecuting the cop for abuse of office as well as breaking and entering. Police wear badge numbers, and other identifying information. This is so that the officer can point to himself in video and say that was me and I saw this suspect do that. It also establishes the authority that goes with the police. Cops who approach your window say something like. \"I am Officer John Smith of the Brookhaven Police Department. My body camera is on to record this interaction for your protection. May I see your license and registration please?\" Identifying himself, his department, and notifying you that his body camera is on and recording. Polite and respectful. I am this person, I am a police officer, and I am doing this as part of my job. The cop will establish the reason for the interaction. You were speeding. You failed to come to a complete stop. You have a taillight out. Some action that justifies the interaction. The Courts have insisted that the cops have a reason. ICE starts out hostile, and goes downhill from there. Someone must have told them they must establish dominance. But all they are really doing is acting like thugs. No identification is shown. Not even an internal number that can be revealed to be a specific agent as a result of a subpoena. Cops take people to jail to be processed into the Criminal Justice System. The accused is allowed to contact a lawyer. Sixth Amendment if you haven't heard of it. ICE and DHS bounce people all over the nation to keep the people from talking to lawyers. In fact, the more enthusiastic your lawyer is to reach you, the more you're moved around and treated badly so you will \"self deport\". That isn't the action of a cop or a law enforcement agency. That is the behavior of thugs. If a cop lies under oath or on his reports. He is at a minimum put on a Brady List, meaning that the Defense is told that this officer or agent has been found to be less than totally truthful in the past. ICE doesn't do that. They give those who lie bonus checks for good numbers. So the idea that you can't be both is now utterly destroyed. At least if you are remotely honest."}

Somebody posted a video of the Black Panthers in Philadelphia legally carrying long guns explicitly to protect the neighborhood and its citizens from ICE violence. That seems consistent with 2A advocates. Here's a situation where a guy was a filming a protest, not brandishing a weapon, and yet ICE crossed the street to confront him, pepper sprayed him, beat him to the ground, discovered and took his legally concealed weapon and THEN shot him as he was lying there. Let me repeat that. They shot him while he was blinded by pepper spray, on the ground, and disarmed. It absolutely mystifies me that anyone, especially 2A advocates, could assign any blame at all to him, or question why someone might bring a weapon to a protest where ICE agents kill people.

Are you a protector of Second Amendment rights? If it is a 2A right to have a gun on your person, legally, than why would it be an issue to have one, as long as its purpose and use maintained legality, when exercising another Constitutional right: freedom of assembly and the right to protest/free speech? You can not have it both ways."}

Click to expand... This makes for an interesting situation on a number of levels. The pro-2A people can't really question the legitimacy of Pretti legally carrying his weapon. He was well within his rights to do so, and unless video emerges of him threatening to shoot agents or going for his gun in the struggle, this doesn't appear to be a justified shooting. It's definitely not justified solely on the grounds of him being in possession of the gun. On the other hand, it's also difficult to portray Pretti as someone who is simply a peaceful protestor if he came packing. The entire pro-2A argument in his defense is one that relies on his motivations being non-peaceful if he felt the need to carry a weapon to defend himself against what he perceived as fascistic government actions. Otherwise, why bring the gun in the first place? It has to be assumed that he was willing to cross the line of aggression if he chose to bring a gun in the first place. Unless he was just going through his normal daily life, carrying his gun as he typically does, and happened upon a situation that led him to pull out his phone and start protesting on a whim. In which case it's entirely plausible that in the spontaneity of the moment, he didn't even think about the fact that he had his gun, particularly if he was just focused on taking video of the event. But then there's the question of why he had so much ammunition packed. Fully loaded and with two full magazines while carrying no identification also looks fishy. And without body cam footage, we really don't know what was said between the agents and Pretti, so that's also very relevant."}

Isn't this type of thing exactly what they were referring to? And yet, they're silent, or worse, saying the guy was stupid to bring his weapon in the first place. You all know who you are. Somebody posted a video of the Black Panthers in Philadelphia legally carrying long guns explicitly to protect the neighborhood and its citizens from ICE violence. That seems consistent with 2A advocates. Here's a situation where a guy was a filming a protest, not brandishing a weapon, and yet ICE crossed the street to confront him, pepper sprayed him, beat him to the ground, discovered and took his legally concealed weapon and THEN shot him as he was lying there. Let me repeat that. They shot him while he was blinded by pepper spray, on the ground, and disarmed. It absolutely mystifies me that anyone, especially 2A advocates, could assign any blame at all to him, or question why someone might bring a weapon to a protest where ICE agents kill people.

Never assume, it gets people killed. You are so wrong in many ways. Police only serve and protect the wealthy. They don't serve the people. They show up after a murder and write a incident report and then leave. A homicide using a gun is the role of a detective, not a hourly paid patrol officer on duty for twelve hours. I have an issue as we absorb the reality that men with a badge think they are law. Not! The are only here to enforce the law. But let me end with this...

I alerted Officer and explained my son and I was going to get in blind at 6am .... he said good hunting #3 was a odd stop a few weeks back - alerted officer to gun, no issue you also know there is a responsibility for carrying then you'd be able to give me hundreds of examples where people have been killed by ICE - the words liberals are using I think needs proof of justification Click to expand... I had my daughter in my backseat and the cop still pulled a gun on us after a traffic stop for simply having an airsoft rifle - remember that's not even a \"real\" gun. You most likely won't recognize your \"white privilege\" but you just acknowledged you were pulled over 3 times with real guns and no issues \"lol good hunting\" while POC get pulled over with a fake gun and we get a gun pulled on us. As far as ICE, there have been roughly 165 deaths since 2003. I've said this before plenty of times, ALL administrations are to blame for ICE and their defiant ways. You might like a large government that violates our civil and constitutional rights but I don't. https://factually.co/fact-checks/government/ice-deaths-documented-since-2003-13984e?utm_source=chatgpt.com"}

It is the choice of truly stupid protesters to think they can carry a loaded a firearm into a tense and dangerous protest where federal agents are being threatened and subjected to being injured by violent protesters. What are those protesters thinking? Are they martyrs for some anti-Trump cause? Do they want to have a statue erected for them a la George Floyd from six years ago? Do they despise Trump and DHS so much they will knowingly put themselves in a no-win situation while carrying loaded weapons? And, someone please tell me, what is the real purpose of injecting oneself into a powder keg of a situation with a loaded weapon when one should know every ICE agent there is carrying a loaded weapon? What was he, Pretti, thinking? Can't wait to read justifications for someone doing something so stupid."}

A gun is always a threat, I dont know what you are talking about. You sound like someone insisting his pitbull is the friendliest pitbull ever, that it is not a threat. Whether a pitbull is friendly is the pitbull's business; it is still a pitbull and a killing machine; pedestrians have to treat it as such.

You try argue he brought his gun to shoot agents because that was the false lie of Noam. Wake up man. The gun was removed and never part of the reasons why he was shot as it was never used. Move on. That lie to justify ten shots failed. More to the point say he had a gun which he clearly never used ...even then you do not in a scrum shoot 10 times threatening the lives of your fellow agents and bystanders.

Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on their last-gasp Affordable Care Act repeal bill without estimates from the Congressional Budget Office of its effects on the deficit, health insurance coverage, or premiums. So someone else has to step in to inform the senators of the measure’s grim consequences. Enter Rebekah Gee, the secretary of the Department of Health in Louisiana—which happens to be the home state of the measure’s chief sponsor, Sen. Bill Cassidy. In a letter to Cassidy dated Monday, Gee offers chapter and verse on how the bill would cut health coverage for 433,000 of Cassidy’s constituents enrolled in Medicaid expansion; eliminate protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions, driving many of them into the “increasingly battered and tattered safety net of public assistance”; and threaten the health of “the unborn and their mothers.” Like all the GOP repeal proposals before it, Gee wrote, Cassidy’s bill “uniquely and disproportionately hurts Louisiana due to our recent expansion and high burden of extreme poverty.” Gee calculates that the bill’s elimination of expansion and capping of federal funding to states would cost Louisiana $3.2 billion through 2026, making Louisiana the eighth biggest loser among all states, “and by far the poorest and sickest state affected by these cuts.” That’s a major threat to “critical access and care for our most vulnerable Medicaid populations including the disabled, children, and pregnant women,” Gee wrote. Gee’s broadside isn’t unique—virtually every responsible healthcare expert and medical organization has said much the same, as has the fiscal analysis firm Fitch Ratings, which judged the measure “more disruptive for most states than prior Republican efforts.” As many as 32 million Americans could lose their health coverage, according to legislative analyses—far more than under previous GOP repeal bills. Cassidy, like Gee a physician, hardly needs to be reminded of the effects of his bill, which is dubbed Cassidy-Graham to acknowledge the co-sponsorship of Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.). If he cared, he wouldn’t have introduced it in the first place. Yet the Republican Senate caucus appears determined to push the bill through without even the semblance of considered discussion. The Congressional Budget Office informed the Senators on Monday that it would be able to produce only “a preliminary assessment” of the measure early next week, but would need at least several weeks more to provide specific estimates of “the effects on the deficit, health insurance coverage, or premiums.” That would place the CBO analysis past the Sept. 30 deadline for the Senate to pass the bill on a reconciliation basis, which requires only 50 votes plus a tie-breaker by Vice President Mike Pence. After that, the bill would need 60 votes to overcome a certain filibuster by Democrats. Click to expand... A scathing and deserved broadside at Sen. Cassidy by the Health Secretary of his home state of Louisiana. Senators Cassidy and Graham have [purposefully] introduced this Cassidy-Graham bill at a late date which will prevent the Congressional Budget Office from having the time necessary to fully study the bill and deliver solid data on its merits and demerits. Healthcare analysts who have reviewed the bill characterize it as worse that the previous failed GOP Senate attempts the Better Care Reconciliation Act and the 'skinny BCRA'. It is critical for success that Cassidy-Graham is voted on in the next week when only 50 Senate GOP votes (including VP Pence if necessary) are required to pass the measure. After September 30, 60 Senate votes will be necessary to pass the bill. This is yet another GOP repeal & replace bill with no Democrat input whatsoever. GOP Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul are expected no votes. Sen. John McCain may again vote no because like the other GOP healthcare attempts, this measure also falls short of his principles to “hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors” on healthcare.

The center of worship, at number 27 Fourth Street in the Versalles neighborhood, is led by pastor Bernardo de Quesada Salomon, founder of Apostolic Move, a Christian movement that separated from the Cuban Council of Churches in 2003. Police agents stormed the pastor’s house at dawn, and violently arrested him and took him to the police station on Avellaneda Street, near the railroad station, according to the evangelical pastor Alexis Segundo Medina, who lives in Camaguey. Several independent journalists and activists have reported police raids and cuts to their phone service to prevent them from approaching the Versalles neighborhood, according to Henry Constantin, a contributor to 14ymedio, who commented before he was arrested for trying to leave his house.

The church Pastor Bernardo de Quesada Salómon has confirmed to the independent Cuban outlet 14 y medio that the building “does not exist; it was demolished entirely.” Catholic churches under the Castroit tyrannical regime have fared a little better than the Protestant churches, due to the fact that Catholicism can practice legally in the island.

The country isn't a business. CEOs are largely responsible to a small segment of the business community: stockholders. That is not the mindset needed to run a country. A president is just as responsible to the the homeless as he is to the billionaire. His bottom line isn't just profit, but what is best for the country as a whole, so I reject the notion that we need a CEO. This limits Romney's appeal.

He understands that you have to talk to your enemies as well has making sure the stick is visible (loved Romney saying he do nearly everything Obama has done during the debate). As for Romney. The country isn't a business. CEOs are largely responsible to a small segment of the business community: stockholders. That is not the mindset needed to run a country. A president is just as responsible to the the homeless as he is to the billionaire. His bottom line isn't just profit, but what is best for the country as a whole, so I reject the notion that we need a CEO. This limits Romney's appeal. As I find little difference other than that between the two, I prefer the one with a more balanced background. Both are too beholden to money, but at least Obama has some sense of the entire country. So, while neither candidate is perfect, Obama really is better IMHO."}

I'm not sure you have a clue how Google works, because Google puts emphasis on most popular, most searched for, nearest to you geographically, etc. Neither of those things is “most appropriate”, “most accurate”, “most respected within it’s field”, etc. (May also want to check that Santorum bit for grammatical sense, because I couldn’t find any) obvious Child said: Did I say it was? My point about Google is using it to find information. You again have a problem with basic information, in getting it, understanding it & merging it with your arguments.

Tucker Carlson is just a clown! Yes, of course the conservative pundits would want to view the election of Bush as a mandate, the very same way idiots like Chris Matthews would want to rant about a Bush mandate for the attention they’d draw as the anti-Bush media… Yes, the Bush Administration were a bunch of hacks! were you not paying attention? Especially after re-election, when the more talented of the bunch jumped ship, & he was left with recycled hangers-on & more good old boy network types, like Brownie. I’m sorry, weren’t you just trying to lecture me on how to formulate a good argument, then saying Bush’s own words about whether enough Americans were in support of his policies constituted a mandate for his policies? Have you seen what I mean about not knowing how to utilize information yet? obvious Child said: See what I mean about Google? Paula Zahn, CNN host: \" A president with a mandate, a 10-seat majority in the Senate, at least 25 seats in the House. So everything should be smooth sailing for Republicans, right? Well, maybe not. \" Chicago Tribune editorial board: \"In trying to advance an ambitious second-term agenda, President Bush has made it clear he intends to make every use he can of the assets at his disposal, starting with the electoral mandate he got last week.\" John Roberts, CBS News chief White House correspondent (now with CNN): \"With the majority of the popular vote behind him [Bush], with the Electoral College win, with a mandate that perhaps many people didn't allow him to have in the first term, can he afford to be more magnanimous with the press?\" Andy Serwer, CNN host & Fortune magazine editor-at-large: \"Interesting time for the president, obviously, he [Bush] seems to have a mandate from the people to go ahead &do what he wants to, his bidding. Where do you think this is going to take him?\" Christine Romans, CNN anchor: \"When I talk to Democrats&people who watch the Democratic machine, they're furious that this was so close again& that now the president has a mandate.\" Michele Kelemen, National Public Radio diplomatic correspondent: \" Others doubt President Bush will change much given his election mandate&his strong convictions in foreign policy. \" Carol Costello, CNN anchor & reporter: \"To American politics now & the mandate. President Bush is promising to use his election mandate to push his agenda forward. \" Ceci Connolly, Washington Post staff writer: \"Well, I certainly think that there is a mandate [for Bush]. I think we have to go a little bit careful in terms of what specifically it is a mandate for . I mean as we've all agreed, a lot was discussed in this campaign. Interestingly, what you heard President Bush focus on was tax reform, Social Security changes, partial privatization. And continuing what he calls the war on terrorism.\" David Sanger, New York Times White House correspondent: \"But Mr. Bush no longer has to pretend that he possesses a clear electoral mandate. Because for the first time in his presidency, he can argue that he has the real thing. \" The New York Times, \"Relaxed, Certainly, but Keeping One Eye on the Clock, \" Dan Chapman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution global economics & business reporter: \" Bush, buoyed by a popular mandate & a more Republican Congress , will probably receive the financial & military wherewithal to fight the insurgency & rebuild Iraq.\" [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \" Bush gets voters' nod on Iraq, but outlook risky, \"] Keith Miller, NBC News correspondent: \"Bush, who won by more than three & a half million votes, has a solid mandate that will force the attention of America's enemies & allies.\" Rafael Lorente, Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Florida) Washington bureau: \" Americans not only gave President Bush a mandate, they also gave him the necessary tools in the form of more Republican House & Senate colleagues to push through his conservative agenda. \" Doyle McManus & Janet Hook, Los Angeles Times staff writers: \" Four years ago, George W. Bush won his first term with fewer votes than his opponent, but governed as if the nation had granted him a clear mandate to pursue conservative policies. This time, Bush can claim a solid mandate of 51% of the vote, which made him the first presidential candidate to win a clear majority since 1988 – a point Bush aides made repeatedly Wednesday. \" [Los Angeles Times, \" Majority Win Could Make Second Term More Partisan, \" 11/4/04] Tony Karon, Time magazine columnist & senior editor: \" George W. Bush took the reins of power with the confidence & certainty of one who had carried a landslide mandate to implement his own agenda. This time, of course, his claim of a popular mandate is incontrovertible. His party has strengthened its grip on both branches of the legislature, & freed of any first-term restraints that might be thrown up by reelection concerns , President George W. Bush is well positioned to even more vigorously pursue his agenda. \" Time Wolf Blitzer, CNN anchor: \" My sense is that the president will see this as a mandate on his policies, because the Republicans also did very well in the House of Representatives, did very well in the U.S. Senate, picking up seats in both . He gets over 50 percent, 51 percent. And he's going to see this as a mandate in the next four years to try & move the country in the direction he wants it to move. He will try to bring the country together in the short term, but he's going to say, he's got a mandate from the American people, & by all accounts he does.\" Renee Montagne, NPR host: \"Well, as you say, the president's people are calling this a mandate. By any definition I think you could call this a mandate. How will he govern?\" Chris Matthews, MSNBC host: \"Good evening. I'm Chris Matthews. & welcome to MSNBC's post-election coverage live from Democracy Plaza in New York's Rockefeller Plaza. Yesterday voters went to the polls & reelected President George Bush, giving him a mandate in his second term.\" Oops Looks like you're wrong... again. You mean like how all those quotes aren't what you said? Seriously, start using Google, or frankly any search engine. Your information is so wrong it's not even funny. Click to expand... LMFAO! Actually, those quotes aren’t what you said… You just helped make my point! You researched & found the words of people who were either heavily biased conservatives arguing in favor of it being a mandate, OR, the words of rational minds who questioned why the Bush Administration governed like they had a mandate when they didn’t, & pointed out that there was trouble brewing ahead… Most of whom were ignominious media characters trying to create something controversial to talk about that would draw reactions from either side, since they entertainment style media… No one seeks them out for knowledge… they seek them out for entertaining delivery & adding the term “mandate” draws attention… Still, most of those quotes pointed out the two things that have already been said in this thread… 1) Bush’s re-election was different from Obama’s, because he not only won the popular vote, but he also extended the advantage to the Senate & House as well… So he was in complete control of the legislature on top of a re-election BY A WIDER MAJORITY THAN HE WAS INITIALLY ELECTED BY!!! So this wasn't just Bush winning a narrow election... it was Bush winning by a wider majority than he was narrowly elected by the first time, Republicans winning the Senate, & winning the House by a wide margin. That's a Republican sweep. That's the mandate they were speaking of... Obama won with FAR less support than he had when he was elected… an appalling amount less, & after having lost the mid-term elections heavily, which in this election, that stayed put, while Republicans kept the House &extended their lead among Governorships. This was a status quo election. 2) As many of them noted, it was Bush, his administration, or his people that were going to try to use it as if it was a mandate, not that it actually was a mandate, & there wasn’t smooth sailing, but stout resistance by Democrats as a result of what they viewed was a false mandate… So please show me a real academic analysis of what constitutes a clear mandate of the people & just how Bush or Obama got a clear mandate from the people… You won’t be able to find one (or you may find one or two, there are a few crack-pots at nearly every college… but you won’t find most historians or political scientist discussing either of these elections as a mandate, or that the people reacted to the election in 2004 as if Bush had a clear mandate & everyone should get behind him… That’s the exact opposite of what happened… People became more opposed to Bush, War protests increased, he had to fight for votes within his own party, & he lost the mid-term elections heavily… The people did not feel it was a pro-Bush mandate… Instead, you’ve just found some popular media articles by “Google”, with uneducated entertainment media hosts pretending to use terms they really don’t know much about… great research there… :roll: But, are you ready for the real ownage? The site you stole all the quotes from (stole, you know… took without giving credit… plagiarized… no wonder you’re such a fan of Obama/Biden)... Clearly pointed holes in the reasoning for calling Bush’s victory in 2004 as a mandate… arguing from the standpoint that it should’ve have been… & it was just the media echoing Dick Cheney’s words… In 2008, will media recall 2004 declarations of Bush \"mandate\"? | Research | Media Matters for America “President Bush was re-elected in 2004 with 286 electoral votes, the smallest popular-vote margin since 1976 (excluding the 2000 election) & the lowest electoral vote count for an incumbent president's re-election since 1916. Nevertheless, many in the media were quick to echo Vice President Dick Cheney's assertion that \"the nation\" gave Bush \"a mandate.\" It remains to be seen whether the media will apply the same standard in assessing the results of the 2008 election.” Their argument was why 2008 wasn’t referred to as a mandate, because it was by far wider that Bush’s in 2004, & I’d agree, 2008 was a mandate, though, more a referendum on the Bush administration"}

Click to expand... Fine. In a few days his Marxism will no longer matter. To answer your irrelevant question in a relevant manner, Click to expand... In your opinion Obama lying and covering up his major policy failure, the policy of pretending things are fine in the Middle East, a major State Department failure, the failure to secure our diplomats and our employees in a very dangerous country, and a major intelligence failure all on his watch is irrelevant? what matters to me is whether or not Americans at home and abroad can count on their fellow Americans in and outside of the government to help them when help is needed. Click to expand... We know the answer is \"not\". When the call came in the president failed. When the POTUS lies to us, I care. Click to expand... Except this time? If I sat down to vote for whether or not Obama is a liar liar pants on fire, I would consider going either way, and I'd want to know the facts and not just the conjecture which you depend upon to make your preconceived judgements official. Click to expand... Uh-huh. Anyone who was open-minded has sufficient information available to reach the right conclusion. Obama-supporters never will have enough information. Why not just admit that you like a little Marxist European-style socialism and move on? But it's so absurd to suggest that a lie from the Obama administration automatically warrants a vote for Romney. Click to expand... Not just from the regime. From the president; from the vice president, from the secretary of state, from her minion, and from other members of the ruling junta. Do you think Romney will have a four year stay in the White House without ever lying to the American people? Nixon lied, LBJ lied, Clinton lied, HW Bush lied, W Bush lied, and yes, Obama lied. They all lie. Click to expand... And here, finally, is the ultimate liberal excuse. Everybody does it. You too? W Bush's administration knowingly used trumped up and sometimes completely false information to convince Americans and congress that we should invade an entire country. Click to expand... Yep. You too. Everybody, including you lie. I understand. That's kind of a big deal, bro. Did you disown W at that point? Click to expand... No. he did not lie. I understand the liberal need to rewrite the past to fit today's narrative. 1984 by G. Orwell was instructive on that point. We vote for a President not because we believe them to be angels in a human guise, but because we believe them to be the better individual to move this country in the right direction. Click to expand... I prefer to choose based on character, morality, and demonstrated leadership qualities. Your mileage may vary. Maybe your blunt post deserved an equally blunt response, so here it is - your arguments make no sense and are based on the completely ridiculous premise that Romney will never lie, is infallible, and can walk on water while inventing a perpetual motion machine. Good luck with your fictional candidate. Click to expand... You have built a straw man. I love that about you."}

You cannot get this reduction in spending as a percentage of GDP under the Romney Plan, because he adds $2 trillion in uncalled for military spending with no stipulation whatsoever that any of it will help Veterans, and he creates a multi-trillion dollar deficit problem with a tax plan that no legit official study says will be deficit, or revenue neutral. So, while the nations fiscal house is already out of control due to eight (8) years of domestic neglect under Bush 43, hiring Romney, will actually make the problem much worse as the data clearly shows. Conservative said: Obama campaigned for the job and said he had the answers. Click to expand... Maybe you should try to actually watch the video (above) that you keep ignoring. His plan was clearly interrupted by a rapidly declining economy - unless you want to now suggest that the 2008 economic implosion never happened? His plans were nothing short of visionary. I've been talking about a new Energy Economy where we patent the technology and sell both Energy, Hardware, Software and Services to developed and developing countries, for eons - certainly long before I ever came to this forum. This President ran on that promise. Unless you want to blame the 2008 economic meltdown on Obama, then there was no way for him to do anything but change his focus to solving the crisis at hand. So, don't sit here and pretend as if the man had no plans, or that his plans were not interrupted by an economy that imploded under Bush 43. Conservative said: For the first two years Republicans could stop nothing and Obama did nothing to promote bipartisanship. Click to expand... Lying about what actually happened, does not strengthen your position. You had leaders within the Republican Party, saying outright that there intent over the next four (4) years was to see Obama fail as President, and you have the audacity to claim that Obama, did nothing to promote \"bipartisanship\" agreement with Republicans? How can you possibly not remember any of this nonsense: Chris, nailed it. \"It's about hatred.\" Conservative said: He generated terrible results and has no proposals to make the next four years any better than the last four. Click to expand... You keep retorting the same tired crap. Where are the terrible results? You've never posted them. All you have ever done is post out of context numbers and declared that they came from the BLS. I post numbers, charts AND the actual LINK to the source, whenever I make claim that stems from the economy. If we are posting from the same pool of economic data, why is your data so messed up? Go READ the first post in the OP. That tells you something about what his results have been as President. Then go READ the links and the posts that I have made in repeated reply to you, that clearly establishes WHERE you keep acting like you have amnesia about how this economy got to where it is today. Obama, found this economy in far worse shape than it is right now. So, when you ask any U.S. Citizen, whether they are better off now than they were when he took office, the answer can't be anything but Yes! There is now a floor under this economy. The auto industry still exists and thousands of top tier as well as substrate industry jobs in the Mid Size and Small Size business category are still alive today as a direct result of the actions taken by this President. Foreclosures are down as a direct result of what this President put into motion. Housing Starts are UP, as a direct result of what this President did. 5 million plus new jobs were created at a time that economists describe as the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression - all as a direct result of the leadership of this President. What kind of recovery would you expect after having GDP dip to below -8.0% under Bush 43, and after losing more than 6 million jobs - before the next President took office, where liquidity dried-up, banks refused to lend, the stock and bond market imploded, fuel prices went ballistic, commodity prices soared and people were losing their homes by the hundreds per day? THAT is what Obama found when he came to office, and much of that has now been turned around. Is the economy still slow? It is supposed to be slow after undergoing something like that. No economy our size would simply spring back to life, on a moments notice that a new President had been elected. It took us eight (8) long years under Bush 43, to get here. It will take us more than four (4) years to get completely out. Conservative said: Maybe you can get over your hatred and ignorance about GW Bush to see that Obama is truly and empty suit, unqualified for a Mid level management position let alone the Presidency. Click to expand... Ignorance of George W. Bush? Can you outline what I'm ignorant about regarding Mr. AWOL at the TANG? Mr. I Lied about WMD in Iraq? Mr. Neocon Puppet, whose Vice President is being given real-time airborne telemetry on an inbound aircraft that neither the FAA, nor NORAD could track on their radar? (how the heck can the Vice President be getting real-time inbound data on an aircraft heading Eastbound, when it LAST known heading was WEST BOUND with radar contact unavailable!

Your supporting a guy who can't keep his lies straight from one debate to the next and who left a State with the 13th largest economy in the country with a jobs creation record that was 47th out of 50th during his term in office. And, you wonder why I am supporting President Obama? All of my posts tell you why, I am supporting his Presidency. Republicans lead the country into the gutter from 2000 through 2008. You tell me WHY on earth should the country return to that mess? What have Republicans learned, done or offered since 2008, that tells anyone they have learned from their past mistakes, are willing to take responsibility for their role in PUTTING US HERE, and have developed a plan where the numbers ADD UP that will build an economy that is finally sustainable long-term? Can you answer that question? Conservative said: I could call you a lot worse but would get an infraction. I never ran from your success as I have no idea what your definition of success really is. I ran a 200 million dollar business and really don't care what you made, what you paid in taxes, nor what Romney paid in taxes. I always celebrated success and if you are successful great, I am sure that is something that someone other than a liberal would look up to. Click to expand... I could care less what you call me - but when you debate me, you had better bring some honesty and some integrity to the floor - or you will get corrected like this summarily. You have not answered a SINGLE question that I have put forth to you and you have repeatedly run and hid from posts that correct your false statements with direct data and links to sources that PROVE the point being made in my posts. So, you can sit here and pretend all you want to actually be responding on the merits, but you don't find anywhere in this thread, where you have actually dealt with the first post in the OP. Not once have you honestly dealt with it. You've slithered around here and danced a mile with nonsequitur, which is a huge wast of my time. Conservative said: The choice thinking people have this year is Obama vs Romney. I didn't vote for Obama because of his resume and won't vote for him because of his results. I will vote for Romney because of his resume and results. If you are truly independent and a successful business person there is no way you can vote for Obama. Why don't you just stay home Click to expand... That just goes to prove just how utterly bias you are in this process. Candidate Obama's resume, looked very similar to a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln, when he was running for President for the very first time. If you had any kind of understanding of our nations History, then you would have already known this. It was one of the stories that was being talked about by scholars and history professors in the media, during the run-up to his election and then again, during his inauguration. But, even without watching television - you should have already known how similar their resumes looked upon entering office. Instead, you were willing to support McCain, who while having a resume sufficient for the role, placed a Vice Presidential Candidate one heart-beat away from the Presidency, who could barely tie her own shoelaces or manage to utter a coherent sentence safely, without help from a coach. So, that tells me that your angst over Obama's so-called resume problem, is hardly worth the screen space it was typed on. As far as Obama's results, you really do seem tone deaf. The first post in this thread is something you might want to fess up to. Regarding Romney's resume, the entire story of Bain Capital, came up missing in the debates and thus far, he's escaped having to answer questions about his role at Bain, or the role that Bain played in shipping American Jobs outside the country. We don't need and Exporter Of American Jobs In Chief, sitting in the White House. If you think that somebody some some LBO experience makes for a good POTUS, then that probably explains your vote for George W. Bush, who turned out to be the most destructive President in the modern era. Conservative said: Congratulations on your gain. Now tell me why anyone successful would ever vote for Obama? Click to expand... First post in the OP. Remainder of all my posts in this thread that prove your economic gibberish to be misleading at best. Conservative said: What is Obama's position on those issues? Click to expand... Asked and answered several times already. You need to learn how to read. Conservative said: What is in the best interest of the principles upon which this country was built is the firing of Barack Obama Click to expand... Not if the hiring of a total liar is the alternative, with a documented history of being involved in the shipping of U.S. Jobs overseas. Conservative said: I don't care what you are or who you are. If you are successful, great. If you are successful you cannot be supporting Obama. The better alternative is Romney and the results show it. Click to expand... And, that's exactly why I posted those details about myself. You Republicans seem to think that you are somehow made of something that other people are not made of. Your failure is born of your arrogance and your arrogance is born of your ignorance. You can't fathom how someone who is successful in business is supporting Obama? What a foolish statement to make - it pretty much says everything I need to know about you. You are not genuine in your assessment of the President. Yours is born of hate, not performance or capability. The very fact that you are supporting a well known LIAR, while lying yourself about what the President has done, and failing to address your own misuse of economic data out of proper context, is proof positive that you are disingenuous at best in your appraisal of what's been done thus far in his Presidency. The very fact that you do not understand the fundamental principle of Cause & Effect, and its relevance to a President entering office on the heels of an economic tsunami, and how the wave of that tsunami cannot simply vanish into thin air merely because one man moves out of the White House and another man moves in, or how the Negative Economic Momentum of that tsunami will wash to shore additional negative economic output in the reports you feign to know so much about and that I study on a daily basis in my own business, is testament to the fact that you are quite simply a severe Hyper-Partisan Hack of monumental proportions. Bottom line: Get real."}

Not once have you honestly dealt with it. You've slithered around here and danced a mile with nonsequitur, which is a huge wast of my time. That just goes to prove just how utterly bias you are in this process. Candidate Obama's resume, looked very similar to a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln, when he was running for President for the very first time. If you had any kind of understanding of our nations History, then you would have already known this. It was one of the stories that was being talked about by scholars and history professors in the media, during the run-up to his election and then again, during his inauguration. But, even without watching television - you should have already known how similar their resumes looked upon entering office. Instead, you were willing to support McCain, who while having a resume sufficient for the role, placed a Vice Presidential Candidate one heart-beat away from the Presidency, who could barely tie her own shoelaces or manage to utter a coherent sentence safely, without help from a coach. So, that tells me that your angst over Obama's so-called resume problem, is hardly worth the screen space it was typed on. As far as Obama's results, you really do seem tone deaf. The first post in this thread is something you might want to fess up to. Regarding Romney's resume, the entire story of Bain Capital, came up missing in the debates and thus far, he's escaped having to answer questions about his role at Bain, or the role that Bain played in shipping American Jobs outside the country. We don't need and Exporter Of American Jobs In Chief, sitting in the White House. If you think that somebody some some LBO experience makes for a good POTUS, then that probably explains your vote for George W. Bush, who turned out to be the most destructive President in the modern era. First post in the OP. Remainder of all my posts in this thread that prove your economic gibberish to be misleading at best. Asked and answered several times already. You need to learn how to read. Not if the hiring of a total liar is the alternative, with a documented history of being involved in the shipping of U.S. Jobs overseas. And, that's exactly why I posted those details about myself. You Republicans seem to think that you are somehow made of something that other people are not made of. Your failure is born of your arrogance and your arrogance is born of your ignorance. You can't fathom how someone who is successful in business is supporting Obama? What a foolish statement to make - it pretty much says everything I need to know about you. You are not genuine in your assessment of the President. Yours is born of hate, not performance or capability. The very fact that you are supporting a well known LIAR, while lying yourself about what the President has done, and failing to address your own misuse of economic data out of proper context, is proof positive that you are disingenuous at best in your appraisal of what's been done thus far in his Presidency. The very fact that you do not understand the fundamental principle of Cause & Effect, and its relevance to a President entering office on the heels of an economic tsunami, and how the wave of that tsunami cannot simply vanish into thin air merely because one man moves out of the White House and another man moves in, or how the Negative Economic Momentum of that tsunami will wash to shore additional negative economic output in the reports you feign to know so much about and that I study on a daily basis in my own business, is testament to the fact that you are quite simply a severe Hyper-Partisan Hack of monumental proportions. Bottom line: Get real. Click to expand... Now the rest of the story, absolutely no reason to give Obama four more years in spite of your distortions and diversions from reality.

Obama's still leading Ohio, and that's all that matters. We could start a campaign for Romney in 2016 though Click to expand... This is the person you are supporting? What the hell is wrong with you? Articles: Military Families are Outing Obama Military Families are Outing Obama By Karin McQuillan American military and State Department families that have lost their sons in the war against Islamic jihadis are outing President Obama for playing politics with the lives (and deaths) of their sons. Speaking out in some of the most painful interviews ever shown on television, they directly blame the president for the loss of their sons' lives. Their accusations speak directly to Obama's competence in defending our national security. Iran is on the brink of possessing nuclear weapons. Egypt's elected President Mubarak, the keystone to stability in the Middle East for the last 30 years, was pressured by President Obama to step down in favor of the terror group the Muslim Brotherhood. The Benghazi embassy was denied Marine protection, even on 9/11, with the subsequent tragedy and White House cover-up. We haven't lost an ambassador since Jimmy Carter's incompetence. Obama's Middle East policy has been a disaster, with one exception -- the killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy SEAL Team 6. The president ran the special ops raid on Osama bin Laden's compound with one eye on national security and the other on political opportunism. Intelligence was compromised because there was political advantage to Obama to do so. Within a day, the White House divulged details of the attack, including that it was carried out by SEAL Team Six. Three months later, 22 men from SEAL Team 6 were dead, victims of Obama's policies and politics. This story has been buried, until this 9/11. Aaron Vaughn Aaron's mother, Karen Vaughn, has a simple message: \"How dare they -- they put a target on my son's back and even on my back! A little over 90 days later, my son was dead.\" Sean Hannity ran a searing interview with Karen and Billy Vaughn, parents of a fallen Navy SEAL Team Six serviceman, Aaron Vaughn. It deserves repeated viewing. Aaron signed up to serve after 9/11 and was killed in Afghanistan in 2011 after the Osama raid, along with 21 other SEALS -- the single greatest disaster in the Afghanistan war and Navy Special Forces history. Robert Gates, the defense secretary at the time, was appalled at President Obama and Vice President Biden boasting about the raid in detail: \"We all agreed that we would not release any operational details from the effort to take out bin Laden. That all fell apart the next day.\" Karen Vaughn: Aaron called me, his tone was extremely serious and he said, mom, you need to wipe your social media clean. Get rid of everything. Any reference of me or my buddies because there is chatter and all of our lives are possibly in danger, including yours. Karen Vaughn says that her son told her the SEALs were angry that their secrecy was compromised by the White House. Aaron felt that it put not only his life, but also the lives of 300 American military families in danger. She adds, \"I can tell you that the community was stunned by the [White House] announcement. It was unprecedented and extremely dangerous.\" As the mother speaks, Aaron's father, Billy Vaughn's face is so full of grief and anger, I can hardly look at him. He looks like he might explode if not for intense self-control. Billy's face was more searing than his wife's words. I don't think I will ever forget it. Then it is his turn to speak. These elite warriors can do anything they want to the Taliban, to al Qaeda if this administration -- if President Obama would just recognize the enemy, give them rules of engagement that favor them, instead of leveling the playing field for the enemy, and give them the equipment that is required to carry out their missions. And I mention those three things because those are other issues that we have found in searching and looking at what happened to Aaron and those warriors on that night, all three of those things were -- were reasons why this chopper was shot down. Why this largest loss in a single day in the 10-year war on terror was caused and also the largest loss in the history of naval special warfare. ...Our president is directly responsible for the rules of engagement. Let me just say this. On the night that Extortion 17 was shot down, this is all from the military -- we learned that the Afghan National Army, the Afghan National Police, the Afghan Security Ministry, are all involved in every single special ops mission, in the pre-planning, the post-op. They know the flight routes of the choppers. That chopper flew in there that night in a place that had already been cleared seven times, according to our military, by our warriors and turned back over to the Afghans. A 3 1/2-hour firefight under way and our chopper flew in with an AC-130 gunship in the air, two H-64s and they were not allowed to give any pre-assault fire. They landed the chopper like it was landing at Wal-Mart even though a firefight was underway. When the chopper was shot down, neither were the AC-130 or the two AH-64s allowed to take out the savages who fired the RPGs because they were standing on a tower. And under the rules of engagement, they didn't know if there might be friendlies in the building. These rules of engagement are criminal for our warriors. In an interview the Vaughns gave this 9/11, Billy said: \"We expect better out, out of the, the high-ups in our government. We, as American citizens, look to our government. We elect them; we look to them to take care of the best interests of the American citizen, and especially the warrior. And I believe what the administration did then -- I believe it was criminal.\" A little-told side to President Obama's running of the war in Afghanistan is the fact that the rules of engagement there are deadly to American soldiers. Under President Obama, average yearly deaths in Afghanistan have doubled. The Obama administration is denying our troops air support and threatening them with prosecution for firing in self-defense. Returning military are protesting, but their voices are not reported in the mainstream media (read here, here, here). Sean Smith There was another heart-wrenching interview the evening before the Ryan-Biden debate that did make it onto prime-time news -- on CNN, no less. Anderson Cooper interviewed Pat Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, father of three, an Air Force veteran and computer specialist who was murdered in the terrorist attack in Benghazi this 9/11. He was my only child. ... I look at TV and I see bloody hand prints on walls, thinking, my god, is that my son's? I don't know if he was shot. I don't know -- I don't know. They haven't told me anything. They are still studying it. And the things that they are telling me are just outright lies. That Susan Rice, what -- she talked to me personally and she said, she said, this is the way it was. It was -- it was because of this film that came out. COOPER: So she told you personally that she thought it was a result of that video of the protest? SMITH: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact all of them did. All of them did. Leon Panetta actually took my face in his hands like this and he said, trust me. ...at first I was so proud because they were treating me so nice when I went to that reception. They all came up to me and talked to me and everything. I cried on Obama's shoulder. And he -- then he'd kind of looked off into the distance. So that was worthless to me. I want to know, for god's sakes. It's my son. I had him for the first -- I told Obama personally, I said, look, I had him for his first 17 years and then he went into the service, then you got him. And -- I won't say it the way I said it. But I said you screwed up, you didn't do a good job, I lost my son. The Obama administration denied the embassy the military security they repeatedly requested. The embassy was forced to rely on hired locals instead of Marines. According to State Department Regional Security Officer Eric Nordstrom, at the congressional hearings held October 11 on the Benghazi cover-up, \"in deference to sensitivity to Libyan practice the guards at Benghazi were unarmed.\" Mr. Nordstrom said that he was forced to a lesser security profile due to reduced staffing. As a result, instead of man-to-man defense, they had to move to zone defense. In other words, they had to rely on help from other areas in the case of an attack while sheltered in a facility that did not meet minimum requirements. Obama lied to the American public in order to promote his major political talking point -- that al-Qaeda was defeated because of bin Laden's death. The administration's false claims of success were put above the safety of our embassy personnel. That is what Pat Smith was referring to when she said to Obama to his face, \"You screwed up, you didn't do a good job, I lost my son.\" Joseph Logan A third story is also receiving coverage -- in the U.K.'s Daily Mail, that is, and on Fox News and Sean Hannity's radio web page. The father of fallen Marine Joseph Logan is speaking out about the condolence form letter he received from President Obama, delivered by a UPS truck driver almost five months after his son's remains were brought home from Afghanistan. The father, Tom Logan, experienced Obama's late, impersonal form letter as profoundly disrespectful: \"It opened up a wound, a hole in our heart, that you can't fix.\" Tom Logan sent the form letter back to the Oval Office with a personal, hand-written message written across the bottom: You, Sir, are an embarrassment to the Oval Office. ... Your ridiculous rules of engagement have caused the massive amount of casualties on your watch in Afghanistan. While we watch your media pander to your administration and clearly sweep things under the rug for you. I understand Marines die. You have tied their hands and feet! I am thankful that I did not serve under a Commander in Chief such as you. I am sickened that my son had to. The families of the 21 Navy SEALs killed three months after the Osama raid also received form condolence letters, each with a huge Barack Obama signature that looked as if it was signed by an automatic pen. Obama did have the time to send a personal letter to rapper Heavy D's family when he passed away, to be read before a crowd of 1,500 at Heavy D's star-studded funeral. It is not as if writing condolence letters would be a big burden on Obama's busy schedule. The Department of Defense reports 1,650 combat deaths in total in Afghanistan since the beginning of the war in 2001. That's a rough average of 150 deaths a year. Obama has played a hundred rounds of golf with White House staffers but can't write a single condolence letter every other day. The contrast with President Bush is remarkable. Bush (who played golf 24 times and then stopped playing in deference to the troops) sent personal letters to the families of \"every one of the more than 4,000 troops who have died in the two wars, an enormous personal effort that ... escaped public notice.\" President Bush also met privately with \"more than 500 families of troops killed in action and with more than 950 wounded veterans ... outside the presence of the news media.\" The first lady (Laura Bush) said those private visits, many of which she also attended, took a heavy emotional toll, not just on the president, but on her as well....\"People say, 'Why would you do that?'\" the president said in an Oval Office interview with The Washington Times on Friday. \"And the answer is: This is my duty. The president is commander in chief, but the president is often comforter in chief, as well. It is my duty to be - to try to comfort as best as I humanly can a loved one who is in anguish. These military and State Department families who have lost their sons since 2008 have lost respect for Obama as commander in chief. They are angry that their sons' lives are cheap to Obama, and their deaths not treated as worthy of his personal attention. As Pat Smith says so eloquently: \"You screwed up, you didn't do a good job, I lost my son.\" Or Billy Smith: \"These rules of engagement are criminal for our warriors.\" Tom Logan: \"I understand Marines die. You have tied their hands and feet! I am thankful that I did not serve under a Commander in Chief such as you.\" All Americans can say the same: in playing politics with national security, Obama is not looking out for our lives.

Two. Here’s another example, from way back in November. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer opened a GOP presidential debate he was moderating by telling the crowd that “yes, that’s my real name.” Romney in turn introduced himself by saying, “I'm Mitt Romney and yes, Wolf, that's also my first name.” Except that it’s not. His first name is in fact Willard. So what was the point of claiming otherwise? Click to expand... Then there was Ryan lying about his marathon time and his mountain climbing skills and his body fat - Why? Why have these two men lied so often about inconsequential ****?"}

I'm a former US Foreign Service officer and can tell you that the statement by the US Embassy in Cairo - which, frankly, seems perfectly OK to me to begin with; what's really so offensive about it that the Obama administration has to \"distance\" itself from it? - almost certainly wasn't cleared with DC, because otherwise it wouldn't have been issued for another day or two! It would have spent that time bouncing back and forth from the Egypt desk up to the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs and over then to Public Affairs and God knows who else getting massaged, tweaked, edited and finally OK'd. The reason embassies have Public Affairs officers is so they can handle this sort of statement on their own, though doubtless the DCM, acting as charge d'affaires in the absence of the ambassador, signed off on it.

I've written about this in several other threads, chasing down your failures to accurately describe WHY there is such slow job growth, even after the technical recession is over. But, you don't care that a liquidity based economy is different than a manufacturing based economy and you don't care that such a infrastructural differential will mean slower than normal economic recover on the jobs scene. All you want to do is score what you think are political points, while never being honest enough to realize just how weak your argument is in the light of what real economists like Northwestern University's Robert Gordon, Harvard's Jeffrey Frankel, and Stanford's Robert Hall have declared about WHY are economy will not be able to put on job growth as seen in the past - given the structural differentials between the economy of 1980/1982 and 2007/2008. You just do not posses the ability to be intellectually honest about the matter. So, why do you even bother? and... Posting \"numbers'' DO NOT explain HOW we got there and how severe the problems were BEFORE we got there. You never address those issues because doing so, would force you to admit that George W.

You also have failed to demonstrate that you know anything about the well known concept of Economic Momentum. Even a small child could understand that, if you put a bowling ball at the top of a tilted plank and allowed it to roll to the bottom, that the ball would have more Momentum near the bottom of the tilted plank, than it would while at rest near the top, or at any point along its path to the bottom. Intuitive, you could demonstrate that to a small child and they would understand it - intuitively, even if they could not describe the Newtonian Mathematics that drive it. Similarly, you could describe to that same small child, the concept of a near $14 trillion economy, retaining \"some\" of its negative momentum even AFTER a technical recession has been declared as being no longer in existence and especially when that economy was so dependent on liquidity from China, Germany and Japan. You know, trying to discuss this matter with you like an adult, has proven to be utterly impossible - because you continually inject your irrational \"numbers\" into a formula that simply rejects your inputs as being insufficient to calculate a result.

Results matter and the Obama results tell it all. You can write books and novels but you cannot defend the indefensible. The numbers posted are today, the worst recovery from a recession in history. Obama cannot be fully blamed for the recession he inherited but he sure can be blamed for the terrible recovery we have. You are great at writing a book that says basically nothing because the results trump your rhetoric and the electorate is seeing that. Amazing how \"Intellectually\" honest Obama supporters really are. Don't you find it telling that Romney is surging in the polls inspite off all those so called accomplishments of Obama? It would be helpful if you just told us all when exactly the economic results and economy become Obama's responsibility? It would be helpful when the attack on our embassies and killing of our Ambassador becomes the responsibility of Obama? It does seem that the electorate isn't buying your novels. Wonder why?"}

Click to expand... There you go again. Spewing misinformation as fact. Your post is indicative of the fact that you don't really understand what a liquidity based economy means, when your primary funding sources dry up and stop providing the same level of compensating balances that enable the same level of credit through the economy. I've written about this in several other threads, chasing down your failures to accurately describe WHY there is such slow job growth, even after the technical recession is over. But, you don't care that a liquidity based economy is different than a manufacturing based economy and you don't care that such a infrastructural differential will mean slower than normal economic recover on the jobs scene. All you want to do is score what you think are political points, while never being honest enough to realize just how weak your argument is in the light of what real economists like Northwestern University's Robert Gordon, Harvard's Jeffrey Frankel, and Stanford's Robert Hall have declared about WHY are economy will not be able to put on job growth as seen in the past - given the structural differentials between the economy of 1980/1982 and 2007/2008. You just do not posses the ability to be intellectually honest about the matter. So, why do you even bother? Conservative said: You mean the recession that Obama claimed to have the answers to? Click to expand... and... Conservative said: The numbers posted come from verifiable sites, non partisan sites like BEA.gov, BLS.gov, U.S. Census Bureau, and the U.S. Treasury site which is the bank account of the United States. Click to expand... Posting \"numbers'' DO NOT explain HOW we got there and how severe the problems were BEFORE we got there. You never address those issues because doing so, would force you to admit that George W. Bush, and his wars for Oil, PSA Contracts and Halliburton No Bid Contracts, are at the heart of the causation. You also have failed to demonstrate that you know anything about the well known concept of Economic Momentum. Even a small child could understand that, if you put a bowling ball at the top of a tilted plank and allowed it to roll to the bottom, that the ball would have more Momentum near the bottom of the tilted plank, than it would while at rest near the top, or at any point along its path to the bottom. Intuitive, you could demonstrate that to a small child and they would understand it - intuitively, even if they could not describe the Newtonian Mathematics that drive it. Similarly, you could describe to that same small child, the concept of a near $14 trillion economy, retaining \"some\" of its negative momentum even AFTER a technical recession has been declared as being no longer in existence and especially when that economy was so dependent on liquidity from China, Germany and Japan. You know, trying to discuss this matter with you like an adult, has proven to be utterly impossible - because you continually inject your irrational \"numbers\" into a formula that simply rejects your inputs as being insufficient to calculate a result. Goodnight, I'll see you guys after the Vice Presidential debate. Maybe by then, you will have developed some intellectual honesty on things economic."}

Sadly, one thing they have gotten correct is that this is an existential battle between good and evil. Democracy and authoritarianism. I reject compromise, I reject reconciliation, I reject the sanitization of their actions. They deserve neither Liberty, nor Safety. Every accusation of theirs is a confession, I believe wholeheartedly. They have cheered, watching legal residents get sent to foreign death camps in chains. These are the actions of vermin. This may make me hateful, or a hypocrite. But I was molded in their image. I get to watch, the democracy I believe in get violated. The values I believe in turned inside out. My countrymen, suffering and dying due to a tyrant's negligence. The natural response, is rage. They asked for hate, they voted to remove the disease from this country's halls of power. On this, we agree. Towards fascists, there is only one appropriate response. Extinction. One does not compromise with the devil, one does not sanitize his actions, one does not pretend he is a moral actor. He is resisted, rooted out, and rejected. People have died. Children have died. That blood is on their hands, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not. Tolerance, should never have been extended to fascist traitors. What can we common people do? We may not be able to remove them from power currently, or put them on trial for their crimes. But, we can ostracize them. We can cease sanitizing the behavior of rats. Our silence is complicity. We must give them a reason to want to take their flags down, while not letting them. Forgiveness died the moment they sent people to CECOT. They have proven that they are unworthy of moral consideration. They don't give that consideration to others. Reciprocity is my word of the day. I refuse to pretend they are anything but a cancer. Who are the decadent, moral degenerates? Probably those who make excuses for a child predator. Who is the enemy within? Probably those who appease our historic enemies, abandon our allies, and storm our capital building. Even their God would reject them, as he values children highly, and has commanded them to heal the sick, feed the poor, and welcome the foreigner. They are wretches by any ethical metric but their own. They are undeserving of the patience we have shown them. It's time we acknowledge this, loudly. They are an existential threat to our democracy, and common decency everywhere. If that isn't clear by now, then it never will be. 1. The ability to participate in our democracy, should not extend to fascists 2. Examples must be made of both ICE officers, and J6ers 3. Trump and his cronies must never be allowed anywhere near public office again 4. Anti-competitive practices by tech billionaires must be addressed, as it allows for disproportionate influence on the levers of power 5. Limitations on campaign funding by corporate entities must be established 6. Those who have voted for this a second, and third time deserve to be ostracized 7. The Supreme Court needs to be emptied of authoritarians, and term limits established I agree with the quote in my signature, and I reject the notion of reconciliation after Trump's term. Those who voted for him again, are either egregiously ignorant, outright malicious, or both. Educating yourself on the candidates is a civic responsibility, which they have failed to meet. Unfortunately, this ignorance has caused actual permanent harm. Which they ignore, as it doesn't effect them. I advocate for the identification of all Trump voters, and their subsequent removal from political participation entirely. I advocate for the expeditious removal of all republicans from power, any complicit democrats, followed by barring them from ever holding public office in this nation again. I believe ICE officers & J6ers should be put on trial for treason, as well as the senior officials within the administration. Our democratic institutions need a reboot, if our democracy is to survive. We must stop catering to, and sanitizing fascists. Moral condemnation is only the first step, it must be put into action."}

Do you learn anything from your fear? Click to expand... Nothing has replaced it. It's certainly still around. It has just been one among a number of other philosophies here in the west: pragmatism, postmodernism, humanism, pluralism, relativism, etc... and has become less attractive as we have realized that all cultures ascribe their latest opinions and cultural norms and beliefs to the order of nature and their gods and deities. And even as the culture changes over time, so does what they have their gods saying and wanting. Did you know that Muslims think it is \"natural law\" for women to cover their hair and face with a hijab for modesty? They can't understand why the women in the rest of the world so flagrantly violate such clear things in the order of nature. And, believe it or not, Christians even used to think human chattel slavery was part of the natural order of things as set up by God. Here is Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the confederacy, to explain: \"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\" Click to expand... You think this was something he made up? And contrary to Christian teachings? Well here is the president of the Confederacy, to argue otherwise: \"\"Slavery was established by the decree of Almighty God. It is sanctioned in the Bible, in both testaments, from Genesis to Revelation.\" -Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America. Click to expand... So there ya go: using natural law philosophy and Christianity to argue for slavery. You can use \"natural law\" to argue anything. I am not sure natural law exists out in nature, or whether the regularities we see out in nature and the cosmos are just some kind of accidental thing. There may or may not be. The scientists themselves are not quite sure themselves. But even if there is, that doesn't help me try to decide how to organize my bookshelf or my room. I am not sure how it would be different for the larger society in which I live either. Just because the planets go around the sun in a certain regular way or the four seasons exist still does not help me decide whether the sweaters should get folded and put away in the drawer, or hung up in the closet. And it certainly doesn't help me decide whether women should be allowed to vote, or slavery made illegal, or gays allowed to get married. All of these different things just have consequences, some foreseeable with some reasonable foresight and judgment, and some not so foreseeable. But just yelling \"natural law\" to push forward my latest opinions on how things should be ordered is not, I have found, a helpful argument."}

For instance, I want a plan that covers me if I get hit by a bus or develop cancer, pure catastrophic coverage. Why can't I have that? Click to expand... To clarify and reiterate Rabid Alpaca's comments: Insurance -- ANY kind of insurance -- is about distributing risk among the ratepayers. The insurers collect insurance payments from people who don't currently need the services, and distribute payments to those who do need them. What this does is reduces the costs of premiums overall. There are numerous issues with health insurance \"a la carte.\" • The essential health benefits pretty much are... essential. There isn't much fat to cut. • It will make plans more complex and confusing. At the moment, the ACA plans specify certain minimum requirements, so you should have a basic idea what you're getting. Even with those minimums and comparison tools in the exchanges, it's can be difficult to sort through plans. If the minimum coverages are removed, then it just gets more confusing, and ratepayers will assume they have coverage that they don't. • With the exception of men and maternity, you really never know in advance what you're going to need -- which is a major reason why we have insurance in the first place. E.g. you may not have a substance abuse problem today, but if your doctor prescribes an opiate-based painkiller, every day you take it increases the chance you'll become dependent on it. • On an aggregate level, it drives up the cost of care. As noted already, insurance distributes the cost over all ratepayers. The larger the pool of ratepayers, the lower the individual costs. So you personally might save a few bucks on your insurance, but doing so will drive the costs for pregnant women through the roof. Oh, and those maternity costs? They're a small percentage of your premiums: { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.\", \"lightbox_start_slideshow\": \"Start slideshow\", \"lightbox_stop_slideshow\": \"Stop slideshow\", \"lightbox_full_screen\": \"Full screen\", \"lightbox_thumbnails\": \"Thumbnails\", \"lightbox_download\": \"Download\", \"lightbox_share\": \"Share\", \"lightbox_zoom\": \"Zoom\", \"lightbox_new_window\": \"New window\", \"lightbox_toggle_sidebar\": \"Toggle sidebar\" } • Along those lines, allowing individuals to select items a la carte creates a freeloader problem. E.g. at the start of the year, you're in good health, so you opt out of most of the services, and go for a high deductible plan (or don't pay at all). Then, you develop an illness that requires an expensive medication for 6 months. You add better pharmaceutical coverage... and drop it when you go off the medication. The end result is that premiums as a whole become more expensive, because those who do pay have to make up for the gaps left by the freeloaders. This is why single-payer plans are generally more efficient. They spread the risk over much larger risk pools and more ratepayers, and do not tolerate freeloaders (since they are paying with taxes). This is also why Romney included mandates in his Heritage-sponsored plan. He referred to it as the \"Personal Responsibility Principle.\" • The incentives don't just affect ratepayers, they also affect insurers. With no required minimums, they will craft cheap plans with minimal coverage, and make broad plans far more expensive. This will cause further distortions, as ratepayers go for the cheaper and skimpier plans. E.g. if you want a plan that covers cancer, you're going to get socked -- because the insurers won't be able to distribute the risk across all ratepayers. • Along those lines, it turns out that killing EHBs could actually increase costs for the government, at least under the disastrous AHCA. In that scenario, subsidies are based on age, ranging from $2000 to $4000 per person, per year. With EHB requirements in place, insurers can't hit that number -- but without them, they can offer skimpy plans that hit the target prices and... encourage people to get more plans that offer less coverage, and line the insurer's pockets at taxpayer expense. This may be why many Republicans refused to eliminate the EHB requirements. ( AHCA tweak could eliminate Essential Health Benefits - Business Insider ) Another way to put this is: In many circumstances, what is beneficial for the individual is detrimental for the nation as a whole. This should not be shocking to... well, anyone, really. Taxes are bad for the individual, but necessary for a nation to function. It's safe for you to not be a police officer or firefighter, but if everyone refuses to perform those duties, no one will be safe. Sometimes, you just gotta take one for the team."}

This is not at all surprising. The Florida Legislature has a record of ignoring referendums passed by voters. They are now trying to give an excuse for ignoring the abortion referendum. Not only did they change the rules to make the minority the winners, they reserve the right to do nothing when a referendum passes. We now basically have a dictatorship where DeSantis makes the laws and the legislature passes them with a rubber stamp. Florida Citizens Decide Issues, Then Lawmakers Ignore Them (1) ​ Ballot initiatives need approval from 60% of voters New law limits contributions to ballot initiatives Florida voters may have thought they had the last word when they approved ballot initiatives legalizing medical marijuana, restoring voting rights to former felons, and raising the minimum wage. That’s not how lawmakers see it. “One of the main reasons that people use the initiative process of Florida is to bypass the Legislature,” said University of Central Florida state politics expert Aubrey Jewett. “On an issue that the Legislature doesn’t like, they have a long record of trying to undermine whatever was passed.” Plus lawmakers keep moving the goalposts, requiring larger percentages of the vote to win, adding restrictions on raising money, and making it harder to get initiatives on the ballot in the first place. A proposal being offered for the 2022 ballot grew out of that tension between legislators and voters.

No, as indicated in a prior post, about the only religion that is okay with it is Hinduism, and I'm not too sure that Indian culture is 100% fine with it either. It doesn't really beg the question. It's about control. The answer really is that simple. Click to expand... But why put the kibosh on homosexuality, especially since 98% of the population is not homosexual? What sort of control is that? I'm sorry but \"control\" does not nearly answer the question. As stated previously, the main concern with religions has alway been adultery. Indeed, the adultery taboo and religious law likely evolved in tandem as a means of organizing the primeval human society so to keep the adult male population from bashing each other's brains in over sexual access to the females. I can see no real motivation for any religion to be overly concerned about masturbation or homosexuality, or even bestiality for that matter. If some of the less attractive men of the tribe are out shagging sheep instead of raping other men's wives there would be all the more peace in the valley. Click to expand..."}

I especially like it when a CONGRESSMAN criticizes Biden for taking so much time off. Have you ever looked at the Congressional “working” schedule? Four days a week at most. Multiple instances of from two to four weeks off during the year. They claim that they need to “meet with Constituents” back home, but that’s just an excuse. Then again, they also need the time to go on their world-traveling and taxpayer-paid-for junkets with their wives all over the world."}

So again, the claims by Trump and Gaetz were corroborated by Milley. Click to expand... Four years later, we can argue about the security failures at the capitol on J-6. What there is no argument about is why we needed security in the first place. If Trump had accepted his legitimate loss, there would have been no riot. The riot/insurrection was 100% Trump's fault. The security failures can be spread out amongst many agencies. Did you honestly think that Trump supporters were going to violently attack police officers and violently break into a federal building looking to hang the VP? I'm pretty sure that even caught people like you off guard. While Trump watched it all unfold !"}

On the flip side, 53 percent rated Trump unfavorably and 54 percent rated Harris unfavorably.

As I have stated, it is not a diagnosable condition since it's a normal part of human consciousness. The behaviour on display by the religious does mimic that of the mentally ill however. Just because it is common place and generally accepted is not reason to affirm it as healthy behaviour however. Thinking irrationally is not something we look at as a higher order thought process. Especially when the tendency works to conflate opposing concepts as being equal rationally, such as believing in Intelligent Design or Creation (theory) as opposed to the scientific fact of biological evolution. This is not confined only to religion, but rather a tendency to think irrationally when assessing real world questions. I really don't want someone like that be vice president for example. I strongly must question that person's ability to discern the difference between fantasy and reality being in a position of power. More than 50% of the U.S. population believes in ghosts. That's just not a healthy perspective to hold in a technologically advanced society so dependent upon science as is ours. It leads to politicians stomping all over science for political reasons when they can not discern the difference between fiction and reality."}

Certainly you can't say atheism rests of a set of religious beliefs, but it does certainly rest on at least an epistemic claim, a set of beliefs as to what makes something true . As you observe, atheism is rooted in an absence of empirical evidence for divinity. However, empirical evidence is not the only sort of evidence. The materialist-atheist's epistemological claim that empirical evidence is the only grounds for truth, as opposed to, say, subjective or faith-based evidence on which a theist might base a truth-claim."}

You'd need a movement, with clear cut demands, rules of engagement, and the like, which actually had a snowball's chance in Hell of accomplishing its goals. I would say we have definitely established that. Click to expand... Yes. THIS is where I would say that attacks against PP clinics become problematic and wrong. They don't limit abortions, they simply give abortionists sympathy points. Click to expand... Yes. And I would say that this, additionally, would justify violence against the doers of violence who mass-murder children. More than 57 million unborn children have been killed in the United States by abortion since Roe v Wade. Click to expand... I'm not denying it. However, the methods under discussion in the OP simply are not the way of accomplishing such a thing. To the extent possible while achieving comparable military objectives. Agreed. Targeting those who murder children, however, is not targeting non-combatant civilians, anymore than firing back at someone who was shooting up a restaurant would be. You are targeting the violent with violence. Click to expand... It's accomplishing basically nothing, while killing and injuring a lot of civilians in the process. Either way, it fails the test. cpwill said: There are always alternatives available. For example, instead of fighting the Islamic State, we could all convert to Islam and submit ourselves to the rule of the Caliphate. That is an alternative . \"Last Resort\" does not mean \"no other possible actions\". It means non-violent alternatives to achieving your objectives have proven unsuccessful and are likely to continue to prove unsuccessful. Click to expand... Negative. That would be contrary to God's law, and therefore is not a reasonable demand. Correct, just as it is when I practice self-defense or the defense of any other. This is correct, and the major restraint against violence against abortionists. Click to expand... Again, open, violent defiance of civil law goes a bit beyond \"self-defense.\" Either way, what we're talking about here doesn't work anyway, so it's kind of a moot point. :shrug: On the contrary, the ending of a mass-murder regime is indeed a restoration of peace. Click to expand... No, in practical terms, restoring peace is restoring peace. If you stop one evil, but basically destroy everything else of value in your society in the process, the \"victory\" is rather Pyrrhic at best. If you are taking part in or enabling abortions to occur, you are part of that process. You are no more a \"non-combatant\" target than you as an intel guy in uniform is in a regular shooting war, simply because you aren't a trigger puller. Click to expand... Does that justify killing police officers and elected officials? That's a rather slippery slope which \"just war theory\" was meant to avoid in the first place. It is a bad idea politically, and a bad idea because the use of violence in this context makes eventual victory less likely rather than more likely. Beyond that, it does not run afoul of the justifications for deadly force. Click to expand... Essentially, yes."}

Great posts overall, throughout the thread; I especially enjoy reading Aquinas' teaching texts. I do have an question re the 'Just War' premises as it applies to judicial supremacy overrunning Constitutional supremacy re the current U.S. government, and how that would effect what is legitimate versus illegitimate re Christians obeying the 'Law', when the 'law' as determined by Federal district courts and the SCOTUS with no relation to the prevailing principles and traditions, which in essence just a form of arbitrary chaos and anarchy based on current whims and fashions. Christianity is amazing at self-correction over time, as its history shows, but should it really accommodate itself to abortions of convenience and the like, to name just one example? I'm an atheist, myself, and I see no reason to 'tolerate' mass slaughter and the dehumanization such practices encourage; it's the politics of self-indulgence carried to an extreme."}

This is more apparent if one looks at more contemporary translations of the \"Just War\" theorem, which spell out a bit more clearly some things which Aquinas' more archaic language only implied. Principles of Just War 1. A just war can only be waged as a last resort. All non-violent options must be exhausted before the use of force can be justified. 2. A war is just only if it is waged by a legitimate authority. Even just causes cannot be served by actions taken by individuals or groups who do not constitute an authority sanctioned by whatever the society and outsiders to the society deem legitimate. 3. A just war can only be fought to redress a wrong suffered. For example, self-defense against an armed attack is always considered to be a just cause (although the justice of the cause is not sufficient--see point #4). Further, a just war can only be fought with \"right\" intentions: the only permissible objective of a just war is to redress the injury. 4. A war can only be just if it is fought with a reasonable chance of success. Deaths and injury incurred in a hopeless cause are not morally justifiable. 5. The ultimate goal of a just war is to re-establish peace. More specifically, the peace established after the war must be preferable to the peace that would have prevailed if the war had not been fought. 6. The violence used in the war must be proportional to the injury suffered. States are prohibited from using force not necessary to attain the limited objective of addressing the injury suffered. 7. The weapons used in war must discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. Civilians are never permissible targets of war, and every effort must be taken to avoid killing civilians. The deaths of civilians are justified only if they are unavoidable victims of a deliberate attack on a military target. Click to expand...

Ahhhh, that's not Christian doctrine. As I've said, the Constitution and our laws are based on Christian principles. The reason isn't the color of the skin. It's being \"yoked with non-believers.\" BIG DIFFERENCE. Question: \"What does the Bible say about interracial marriage?\" Answer: The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4). However, the reason for this command was not skin color or ethnicity. Rather, it was religious. The reason God commanded against interracial marriage for the Jews was that people of other races were worshippers of false gods. The Israelites would be led astray from God if they intermarried with idol worshippers, pagans, or heathens. This is exactly what happened in Israel, according to Malachi 2:11. A similar principle of spiritual purity is laid out in the New Testament, but it has nothing to do with race: “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14). Just as the Israelites (believers in the one true God) were commanded not to marry idolaters, so Christians (believers in the one true God) are commanded not to marry unbelievers. The Bible never says that interracial marriage is wrong. Anyone who forbids interracial marriage is doing so without biblical authority. A couple considering marriage needs to weigh many factors. While a difference in skin color should not be ignored, it absolutely should not be the determining factor in whether a couple should marry. An interracial couple may face discrimination and ridicule, and they should be prepared to respond to such prejudice in a biblical manner. “There is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him” (Romans 10:12). A colorblind church and/or a Christian interracial marriage can be a powerful illustration of our equality in Christ.

The 26-year-old security guard's so-called vacation ended in a hail of bullets Tuesday. FBI and Boston police officers tailing him suspected he was about to launch an attack. An associate, David Wright, 25, was arrested and charged with obstruction. The investigation into the depth of Rahim's network and possible overseas connections comes amid concerns by counterterrorism officials about future plots from a growing number of U.S.-based ISIS sympathizers. Using social media as well as encrypted online communications beyond the reach of law enforcement surveillance, the terror organization is increasingly reaching new sympathizers and encouraging attacks such as the one foiled in Boston, officials said. \"The foreign terrorist now has direct access into the United States like never before,\" Michael Steinbach, assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, told the House Homeland Security Committee this week.

Click to expand... :roll: Okay, here we go with this about \"x country is not a democracy.\" I'm happy an American socialist once corrected me on this way of thinking and broke me from the chains of it. Listen, there are countries with a multi-party system that have like 3, 4, 5 major parties and then a slew of minor parties participating it its respective democracy. The USA on the other hand is a two-party system . And it is so by design. You have Americans even boasting of the efficiency of limiting a democracy to no more than 2 parties that rule, and only conceptualizing democracy as \"more than one party\" (like Cuba). Even though democracy really only means \"rule by majority\" that concept rarely enters the American's mind, rather a rule by minorities is how Americans have bee taught over the last several decades to think. The United States has no monopoly on what constitutes a democracy. The USA thinks its the most democratic nation on earth like ISIS thinks it's the most Islamic nation on earth. Listen, Syria held an election, Assad won the vast majority of the votes, and not a plurality of votes like a lot of US Presidents are elected. So, the vast majority of Syrians voted him to stay their top executive leader and at the end of the day that's what democracy is . Secondly, Russia has separate branches of government. Which Putin has used and gotten okay from to enter places like Syria and Crimea. Obama and Trump never had to go to Congress or the American people for a damn thing related to bombing this or that in Russia or overthrowing governments in the Ukraine. Warhawks like McCain and Hillary Clinton had/have been in political office longer than Putin has. Okay, so, in the USA no President would be able to leave Presidential office and become Vice President, rule de facto from that position and then run later and get elected again as President. But Russia is not the USA. Worry less about Russia and more about the problems in the USA. And actually, I think it has worked out well for Russia by Putin switching positions so many times. He's a leader that has his feet planted on the ground enough to know American NGOs are often working for the CIA to cause cultural revolutions and problems in other countries. As for Syria, the conflict has been dragged out by the busy body USA conniving and fostering violence there because the American tax payers fund it while American super-rich with special interests don't have to privately finance the rebels and Syrian war. But they stand to make kickbacks $$$ I'm sure by getting in Saudi compliant leaders to run pipelines through Syria. Or who knows... the only thing sure is the US is not \"there\" out of pure love and benevolence."}

Mike Pence Won't Dine With a Woman Who Is Not His Wife If Pence can’t eat alone with a woman — which also implies he’s not allowed to be alone with a woman — the end result is that he’s going to work with, mentor, and promote men over women. In politics, after-work dinners and drinks are where meetings are routinely held, strategies are hashed out, career advice is doled out, information is shared, and relationships are built. If men like Pence won’t engage with women one-on-one in informal settings, it’s the women who miss out — because it’s still men who run the show. It would be awfully hard for a woman in any high-powered industry to have a same-sex-only dining rule, because there are simply so few women at the top of their fields in politics, business, technology, and law. Ladies-only lunching (or dining of any kind) would mean the inability to meet individually and informally with the overwhelming majority of leaders in your field.

Pence will not attend events where there is alcohol present without her by his side, either. Some people have defended Pence by saying that as an evangelical Christian, he is simply practicing his faith and safeguarding his marriage by “avoiding temptation.” Several conservative men said they don’t see any reason to dine alone with women either. On Twitter, Matt Walsh, a conservative blogger, asked what an “appropriate reason” would be to eat a meal with “the other sex” outside of family. Erick Erickson, a conservative blogger and radio show host, responded that there are only two acceptable reasons: planning a surprise party or a funeral. Click to expand... In a way i hope this is a fake news thingy, because it is just far to bizarre to be real. Unless someone can come up with a better reason for this, then it has to be some kind of weird misogynist thinking. It is either that a mans natural inclination is to screw any women who gives him the least bit of encouragement, ie, dining alone with them. Or they consider women so depraved that they will sleep with any man given half the chance. There is nothing good in this, the christian men hold no moral high ground with this thinking. In fact it is harmful to women in that in can hold women back from advancing their careers."}

Click to expand... I think the attacks are at least 3/4th's bizarre. For one thing, when we take a look at the rest of this administration's scandals, policy disagreements, policy consequences, and the greater disorder between two of the three branches of the federal government, one wonders how this can look anything but tame in comparison and/or make Pence look quite alright. But, even suppose this is something that needs to be exposed as something more than marital sexism. Okay, so in some circles we have discussion that this rule has, for instance, harmed the professional development of women church leaders. In others we have the discussion that shows that this can lead to continued isolation or stagnation of females in the secular workplace. But, do we have a face to this poor work environment for Governor Pence or Vice President Pence? No. At the moment the only face we have to this is Pence and his wife saying that neither want to have the whiff of sexual innuendo. In other words: Pence stays out of trouble by not even creating the rumor mills in the first place."}

Twenty years now have passed since male professors were \"strongly encouraged\" to always have the door open when meeting with a female student. This became profs of both genders having the door open or at least half-open when meeting with most students. Why? Because it's not at all uncommon for a disgruntled student to claim that a prof has made a sexual overture. Sad, but true. It's just so much easier not to tempt fate."}

You assume in a scenario that the boss is a male. Because in a male dominated business world that is probably correct. So where it is a situation of just two people talking then it is also a situation where the woman has been put in a disadvantageous position where she loses the ability to network and must therefor work harder than a male to achieve the same.

If she is trusting then she has no need to heed rumours. The loving husband and wife choose not to even prompt such a question.

And he also never gave me a reason to doubt his fidelity--he has been the one person in my life I could count on unconditionally to be there for me when I needed him and to be a witness to my life. And I have done my best to be the same for him. Does that mean that we have never been disappointed or frustrated or angry with each other? Of course not. But when you marry the right person, you work through those times and emerge stronger. Vice President Pence is my idea of a real man who loves his wife and chooses not to put her in a position of having to put aside doubts. I believe a real woman gives the same gift to her husband. Blessed are those who look for and achieve that kind of marriage."}

Well, president and founder of Answers in Genesis-U.S. and the Creation Museum, Ken Ham, says they were in Noah's Ark. Although he doesn't reveal exactly what happened to them after that, Ham announced in a new radio ad*posted to YouTube on Monday*that God created dinosaurs and he told Noah to take pairs of them into the ark before the biblical flood. Ken Ham Irked by 'Hypocrisy' of Secularists Over 'Loch Ness' Story \"Evolution has used dinosaurs more than almost anything else to indoctrinate children into millions of years of evolutionary ideas.* Evolution has claimed dinosaurs evolved over 200 million years ago. That no humans ever lived with them…that some mysterious event led to the extinction of dinosaurs,\" says Ham in the one-minute ad titled \"What Really Happened to the Dinosaurs?\" \"But the Bible gives a different history. God tells us he created all land animals the same day he created man about 6,000 years ago and what's more there were even dinosaurs on Noah's Ark because God told Noah to take pairs of every kind of land animal. You see, dinosaurs are no mystery at all if you accept the Bible's account of creation,\" notes Ham. A*Slate report*mocked Ham last year for his campaign to \"take dinosaurs back\" from \"secular humanists\" who have held dinosaurs hostage for decades. \"Creationists, in Ham's view, should use dinosaurs as star attractions to get the public to imbibe the religious swill he and his organization peddle. Dinosaurs are unlikely symbols of religious fundamentalism,\" notes the report. \"The first dinosaurs evolved about 230 million years ago, and, with the exception of birds, perished about 66 million years ago. Archaic humans didn't originate until 60 million years later, so it's not surprising that Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and kin aren't mentioned in the Bible. Of course, Ham and like-minded literalists would beg to differ,\" it adds. Yahoo*reported last year*that the Creation Museum had its lowest attendance since its opening in 2007. It noted that 280,000 people visited the museum in the last fiscal year compared to the 404,000 who visited in 2007. Creation Museum's \"Noah's Cafe,\" Ark Encounter Vice President Michael Zovath chalked up the attendance drop to the bad economy while the report pointed to its heavy advertising. \"It's a way to get kids to come to the museum, that's the whole purpose of advertising,\" Zovath says of the ads. \"The common response is, well, you're trying to attract children to your museum so you can teach them something we don't believe in. That's probably true,\" he notes. \"But secular museums and most natural history museums, when they run a dinosaur exhibit it's to promote attendance, and they're trying to teach kids things we don't believe in.\" Read more at* http://www.christianpost.com/news/di...qbAJB24Zxco.99"}

But just because someone does some good things doesn't mean that he also doesn't do bad things, and have seriously evil intentions. Even notorious killers do engage in certain nice/positive things, like Charles Manson who plays the guitar, and Adolph Hitler who did oil paintings. On the negative side of Wahhaj, there's plenty to talk about. He has been quoted as having said “white people are devils.\" He said of this, “I preached it. I taught it.” (Wikipedia). He has been vice president of the Islamic Society of North America since 1997 (Wikipedia), which in addition to being part of the notorious Muslim Brotherhood (# 1 Jihad org in the world), was also named by US Justice Dept. prosecutors as \"unindicted co-conspirator\" in the Holy Land Foundation trial, which sent members of them to prison for up to 65 years (life), for sending money to Hamas . He also has publicly procalimed the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood as being his own, saying that Muslims need to elect a caliph to take over the United states and then establish a caliphate, and could do so if only they were more astute. (Beila Rabinowitz and William A. Mayer, Florida Islamic Conference Outed as Jihad-Fest, Pipe-LineNews.org , Dec. 19, 2003). also (Jagan Kaul, \"Kashmir: Kashmiri Pundit Viewpoint\", Kashmir Telegraph , May 2002). Addressing a Muslim audience in New Jersey, Wahhaj went on to say \"If we were united and strong, we'd elect our own emir [leader] and give allegiance to him. . . . [T]ake my word, if 6-8 million Muslims unite in America, the country will come to us.\" ( The Danger Within: Militant Islam in America :: Daniel Pipes ) Want more ? Wahhaj sponsored talks in New York City and New Jersey mosques, by Sheik Omar Abdel Raman, the \"blind sheik\" who was convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center, in the 1993 bombing of it. Wahhaj himself was designated an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" in that case. All these are in line with Wahhaj's warnings that the United States will fall \"unless it accepts the Islamic agenda\".

I know plenty of brothers who have gone from NOI to Sunni Islam, and they become entirely different people. NOI was mostly desirable to blacks as a liberation and political force, while Islam is a religious one that preaches against racism. Imam Siraj Wahhaj has often spoke against racism, and if you knew anything about him, you would know that he most often speaks on the podium with Shaykh Hamza Yusuf, who is a white convert to Islam. While Wahhaj credits the Nation of Islam for giving him “black pride,” he now says that the pride went too far when it spilled over into denigration of others. “In those few years with the Nation of Islam, I was other than myself,” he concedes.

Click to expand... Joke, Joke, Joke, Joke, Joke, and Lie! ISNA is an extremely mainstream moderate organization, and hosts the largest Islamic conference in North America. I go every year, and it is filled of interfaith activity and peace-preaching. Go read more about them, buddy. They even had a US military recruitment booth there :/ And no, the Holy Land Foundation did not fund terrorism. These are false allegations. They gave money to a hospital in Gaza that was run by Hamas, and thereby, accused of funding Hamas. This was money in Zakat, which cannot go to fighting Jihad. If it did go to fighters, then they obviously did not know about it. On another note, there are plenty of Hamas institutions in the West Bank and Gaza, and they are the most well-organized, because whether or not you think Hamas is a terrible organization - the masses of their members do ACTUALLY care for the people, as opposed to Fatah, who would simply pocket the money.

Take an example: YouTube - ISNA Convention 2009 - Session 8A Part 7 ...so this is what that radical imam preaches at that radical organization... tolerance towards other religions, shared similarities, beliefs, and practices, and being good human beings!

Compatible couples are most likely to have a successful marriage. Married couples are supposed to have teamwork - each have their own roles - aiming for the same goal. Think of the two in a canoe. You'll never reach your destination if you're not paddling towards the same direction. Religious belief is a big deal. It will be a bone of contention later on if the couple don't have the same values. Children will become greatly affected if there is no consistency between parents.

There can only be one president to a nation ( and he has his vice president) - otherwise it's an endless power-grab contention all the way!

If women have a big problem with that part of a Christian life - then, don't get involved with a Christian man. As simple as that. What others don't get....

[note: this isn't \"new data,\" this is just someone bothering to look at all the available data--GB] Premiums for silver plans on the federal insurance exchanges are slated to increase an average of 5.8 percent in the eight states where all data is available, according to an analysis by Avalere Health. For the lowest-cost silver plans, that increase will be 4.5 percent, or an average of $378 per year. . . “While recent public attention has focused on a subset of plans that filed for premium increases of 10 percent or more, these data reveal that most plans are proposing more modest increases,” said the group’s senior vice president, Caroline Pearson.

Oregon's premiums in 2016 will be about $2,000 (37%) below what we were \"promised\" to get the ACA passed 5-6 years ago. More importantly, there are good indications the risk pools stabilized fairly quickly after the initial jump in 2014, as 1) pent up demand among the sickest earliest enrollees was addressed, and 2) the risk pool expanded during the second open enrollment to bring in healthier folks. Obamacare patients cost insurers less than expected last year Not so long ago, critics of Obamacare were warning of death spirals, the risk that too many sick people and not enough healthy ones would sign up for insurance, triggering a cycle of ever higher costs for insurers and steep premium hikes for consumers. That didn't happen.

As far as premium trends go, KFF's look at major metropolitan areas and Avalere's early look at states that publicly released all premiums suggest the markets are more stable than the headlines let on (though, as with last year, there will be volatility with respect to which company is the market leader in any area--that's why people ought to shop and why markets are being used here in the first place). Lowest-Cost Exchange Premiums Remain Competitive in 2016; Consumers may be able to keep increases small by selecting a low-cost silver option A new analysis from Avalere finds wide geographic variation in 2016 premium increases for individual market exchange plans, based on proposed rate filings in eight states where complete data is available. Specifically, premiums for silver plans will increase 5.8 percent on average across the states analyzed, ranging from a 12.0 percent average increase in Oregon to a 5.3 percent decrease in Michigan. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of 2015 exchange enrollees picked silver plans. “While recent public attention has focused on a subset of plans that filed for premium increases of 10 percent or more, these data reveal that most plans are proposing more modest increases,” said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere. “Notably, final premiums could be even lower than those proposed.” Click to expand..."}

Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 220 By using the word 'Terror' for ru'b, the Islam-hater intends to convey the following definition of terror: Violence committed or threatened by a group to intimidate or coerce a population, as for military or political purposes. (The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition) However, the word ru'b does not have that meaning at all. It refers to fright and anxiety. In fact, we can derive a better understanding of ru'b by examing other ahadith: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"I was given victory through Ru`b (fear and anxiety): the enemy becomes filled with Ru`b (fear and anxiety) even though they are the distance of a month's journey away from me.\" (Ahmad #20337) The meaning is thus obvious that when the enemies' attempts to destroy the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) failed, they began to fear him as he grew in strength in Arabia and gained more followers. They feared and hated the religion he brought which preached equality and morality and would remove them from their position of corrupt tyrants who enslaved the poor and the non-Arabs. It was fear of the mysterious power which granted Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers such rapid success. This fear was not the fear that resulted from past combat, as many Islam-haters would have us believe, rather it was a type of fear which prevents further combat. As Jalal Abualrub notes: Ru`b ', means, ‘anxious with fear': Here is a list of some of the Islamic resources explaining, ‘Ru`b', as, ‘Exessive Fear', and, ‘Awe': Fat`h al-Bari bi Shar`h Sahih al-Bukhari ; Tu`hfat al-A`hwadhi bi Shar'h Jami' at-Tirmidhi ; and, Shar`h Sunan an-Nasaii . These books were written by Muslim Scholars explaining Hadeeths contained in, Sahih al-Bukhari , and the Sunan collections of Imams at-Tirmidhi and an-Nasaii, respectively.... Al-Waqidi said in his, Maghazi , that Juwairiyah Bint al-Harith said, “ We were at the Muraisii` area when the Messenger of Allah marched forth towards us. I heard my father say, ‘There has come to us a gathering that we cannot resist.' I saw men and horses in such numbers that I cannot describe. After I became Muslim and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, married me I looked at the Muslims and found their numbers to be less than what I had thought. I knew that this was Ru'b (excessive fear) that Allah, the Exalted, throws in the hearts of the polytheists.'” There are many similar examples in which the enemies of Islam, who, just like the Muraisii` people, had gathered armies to attack Madinah and the Prophet, scattered throughout the desert in fear when they heard that the Prophet had gathered an army to resist their treacherous attacks. Many lives were saved through Allah throwing fear in the hearts of the enemies of Muhammad, peace be upon them, because his enemies feared him, fled and did not meet him in battle. Thus, ‘excessive fear', in the Hadeeth...saved Muslims and many of their enemies the hardship of battle and warfare. (Abualrub, The Prophet of Mercy, emphasis added) So, the fear that the disbelievers had of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) can justly be compared to the fear a thief or murderer would have of a police officer. . .

As I've said, there are other groups with higher suicide rates than the general population, for many of the same reasons but also different ones. Military members/veterans (since many suicides happen at home, even after the person is out of the military, a civilian), police officers, homosexuals, farmers, lumberjacks, fishermen, teenagers, and many others because of so many different factors. These jobs have the highest rate of suicide | WTSP.com Residents of Wyoming have a higher suicide rate than those in DC, by almost a factor of 6. QuickStats: Age-Adjusted* Suicide? Rates, by State§ ? United States, 2012 There are just so many factors to suicide."}

'kay. dictionary.reference.com said: in⋅volve –verb (used with object), -volved, -volv⋅ing. 1. to include as a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence; imply; entail: This job involves long hours and hard work. 2. to engage or employ. 3. to affect, as something within the scope of operation. 4. to include, contain, or comprehend within itself or its scope. 5. to bring into an intricate or complicated form or condition. 6. to bring into difficulties (usually fol. by with): a plot to involve one nation in a war with another. 7. to cause to be troublesomely associated or concerned, as in something embarrassing or unfavorable: Don't involve me in your quarrel! 8. to combine inextricably (usually fol. by with). 9. to implicate, as in guilt or crime, or in any matter or affair. 10. to engage the interests or emotions or commitment of: to become involved in the disarmament movement; to become involved with another woman. 11. to preoccupy or absorb fully (usually used passively or reflexively): You are much too involved with the problem to see it clearly. 12. to envelop or enfold, as if with a wrapping. 13. to swallow up, engulf, or overwhelm. Click to expand... Unless you directly confronted them on their praying, I don't see how you were involved. Slippery Slope said: I never said they don't have the right. Let's not stray from the path of the conversation into something I wasn't objecting to. Remember the point of the anecdote was to point provide an example for someone who asked me a question. Here again, you lose sight of why I provided the anecdote. Click to expand... You're using the anecdote as an example to prove a point: Christians are trying to push their religion on everyone else. If the example was of someone continually harassing you on the street (or at your home) to convert to Christianity it would be quite relevant to your point. However, this is a family praying at a meal. At worst they would be loud enough to be vocally disruptive. Other than that it's like the guy on the phone, or the laughing schoolgirls. They're in their own sphere of influence and not directly affecting you. Now, you can choose to be affected by listening to their conversation or prayer, and get involved by confronting them. As it is, I'd recommend finding a more relevant example to prove your point... unless your intended point is entirely different. Slippery Slope said: I believe Jesus had something to say about how to pray... do you know that passage? Click to expand... He did indeed. The target audience for that passage was towards the high priests, who would get down on their knees in public and shout their prayers in order to draw attention to themselves. Similarly, they would make a big show of giving coin to a beggar. Jesus was opposed to making a big show of devotion, instead teaching that believers should do good deeds without regard for public opinion (and in fact, make efforts to avoid attention). Going back to your example. If the family praying was obviously trying to make a big show of their prayer, and then arrogantly rebuffing anyone who took issue with them being loud, your argument would be valid. If they're simply having a prayer with the entire family it then becomes an issue of personal discomfort with the subject at hand. Slippery Slope said: As I've claimed in almost every thread I've been involved in regarding xianity, if the religious would keep their religion to themselves I would have no problem with them or their religion. You can pray all you want, you can believe whatever you want, just don't involve me by pushing your dogma into politics, whining about your nativity scenes, and harassing others. Click to expand... Those are much better examples to prove your point. I do agree religion and politics mix about as well as water and oil. We do have guaranteed freedom of belief. However, while the nation itself isn't Christian the vast majority of the population does believe in God. People will vote for politicians that represent their own interests. In regards to harassing others, I agree that it is completely wrong to force one's belief system (or lack thereof) on others. To be fair, I do have to point out that Christians are hardly the only guilty party. Jews, Muslims, Scientologists, atheists, political parties, activist groups, and many other (lack of) belief systems have their fundamentalists, evangelicals, and vocal majorities. It's a problem inherent in the human condition. Another interesting point... just what would you define as 'keeping their religion to themselves'? Slippery Slope said: You mean the way god went looking for adam while adam was hiding? Or when god became angry at the sinful ways of man and flooded the planet or ... need I continue with all the various ways the your omniscient and omnipotent god seems to not be omniscient and omnipotent? Straight from the bible... Click to expand... I had an interesting conversation on the subject of the Bible with some fair intellectuals. One of them suggested that the book of Genesis is meant as a metaphorical text, not a literal history. The argument went on to discuss the nature of oral tradition and legend, but the general idea stuck with me. I'm by no means an expert on the subject and truly understanding all the meanings and metaphors will take some in-depth research. If I try to explain what I know now it'll make no sense and get mercilessly stomped, so I believe I'll let the matter lie. Slippery Slope said: And I explicitly stated that your subjective proof isn't really proof. And it's not. Click to expand... Subjective proof is not objective or scientific proof, no. However, you seem to be missing the point. The proof I have applies to me . It will likely not apply to you or anyone else on this board. It comes from my own personal experiences and observations. Again, it is not objective or scientific proof, and I have made no effort (nor will I) to pass it off as such. Slippery Slope said: Thank you. Click to expand... No problem. Hypocrisy amuses me. :2razz: Slippery Slope said: So what parts of genesis are we supposed to take as literal and which parts are metaphorical? :roll: Click to expand... Like I said, I have a notion that the entire book is metaphorical. On the question of how it's metaphoric? Best answer I can give without confusing the hell out of everyone and getting my ideas misunderstood: I dunno yet, I'll get back to you. Slippery Slope said: So now it's the humans that are responsible for nature and not god? I don't believe that man creates hurricanes... Don't you believe god does? Click to expand... Let me clarify. We are responsible for war and famine. Natural disasters are only disasters because we are involved. So yes, in a sense, we are responsible. A hurricane is created by a complex weather system. For millions and millions of years, nature did it's thing without us. However, when we go and build a city that's below sea level in a region where hurricanes are common, we shouldn't be wondering why it suddenly gets flooded. Slippery Slope said: I agree (except for the natural disasters, we can't stop a tornado from happening), I simply disagree that we need to believe in a deity to accomplish these things and I believe that religion is actually a deterrent to those things. Click to expand... I will actually agree with you on the point that religion might not even be necessary. However, I will disagree that it is a deterrent. What were to happen if Christians followed the command to love one another as themselves? I think we can both agree that the Golden Rule would certainly make human interaction less frictional. Yet we still see wars and intolerance abound in the name of religion. Religion is often used by people as a tool, turned into a means to achieve power or excuse crimes against humanity. As I touched on before, this is not a failing of religion, but a failing inherent to humans. If you take religion out of the equation, people will still lie, cheat, steal, murder, and otherwise commit horrible atrocities against their fellows. They'll simply find a different excuse. When I said religion was a tool, it can also be used for good. Many charities, aid organizations, and soup kitchens are faith-based. While some Christians warped the Bible to support slavery, others were opposed and did everything in their power to help escaped slaves. Martin Luther King Jr. based much of his nonviolent resistance on Christian principles. Unfortunately, people are likely to forget a helping hand when they see a closed fist. More attention is called to the negative than the positive. I won't dare say for a second that there are many problems with religious belief, but I can certainly find just as many problems with nonbelief. Slippery Slope said: And right after that they want to end social programs and bash gays and make a womans choice illegal and prevent a portion of society from having certain rights and burn crosses on peoples lawns and blow up federal buildings and... shall I continue? Click to expand... Shall we go down the list? There are some social programs that I do want to end. However, they are generally financially wasteful things that do little to help. Everything to do with politics, nothing to do with religion. I don't bash gays. I may not agree with some of the lifestyles, but I do have several friends who are gay and I have no intention of bashing them or anyone else. In fact, I support homosexuals being able to get a civil union and enjoy the same rights and privileges as a traditional married couple. I wouldn't call it marriage since it has too many religious and traditional connotations, but the end result is the same. I think that in cases where a woman is unable to carry a child to term and give birth that an abortion would be necessary. However, I strongly oppose the use of abortion as a casual contraceptive. Does this mean I want \"woman's choice\" to be illegal? Not in the least. Not quite sure which portion of society you're referring to. I don't think that felons should have all the rights that we do. Beyond that, you'd have to get more specific with your generalizations. Burning crosses on people's lawns? I've burned things, occasionally on my lawn. I don't ever recall hearing about Christians burning crosses at all. While watching a building get demolished is fun, I have no intention of ever blowing up any buildings, much less federal ones. I've come to the conclusion that you are talking about some specific subset of Christianity. As I just demonstrated, I have done none of the things you listed. I have no intention of doing any of the things you listed. And yet, I am a Christian. I have many friends and family who are Christian, and at worst they don't agree with the homosexual lifestyle. Nor do they make sweeping, generalized assumptions on an entire group when there is strong empirical evidence right in their faces that those assumptions are patently false. And, just 'cause it's funny: Ooga booga."}

There was a blurb in the bulletin instructing parishioners not to give to the homeless and/or panhandlers outside the cathedral, that if they wanted something they would have to go to a Catholic soup kitchen, and the police officer was there to shoo away the undesirables. Instruction not to show charity to the poor and the implication that they would have to take two tablespoons of catechism with their meal or go without really rubbed me the wrong way."}

Especially the bottom 15 countries, which have entirely different cultural norms. It's illegal to be an atheist in most of those countries. How can you compare that to the West? Click to expand... No, it's not illegal to be an atheist in most of those countries. Jesus Christ, are you even capable of using Google or do you just make up whatever you want? And I cited a country that has seen reduced Religious strength and power in the past years as the richest nation in the world. And I cited two regions with the US that are doing very differently and have very different religious strengths. You ignore all of this because you don't actually have an argument. You are soapboxing. Well, data from 1960 is necessarily going to be old. But the surveys were taken up to 2010. Click to expand... Wow. Small sample surveys blended with old data. That is suppose to tell us what? See the argument above about differences in cultures. Do I really need to explain this further? Click to expand... No, I have to explain this to you. It's culture that matters, not religion . Highly religious countries range from basket cases to economic powerhouses. On one hand you have Nigeria who's dirt poor despite having oil and then you have Japan where Buddhism and Shinto are beliefs held by virtually everyone there and Japan can economically punch well above its weight. I then cited Detroit, a city with strong religious roots that we all know is a joke, compared to San Francisco which, despite low religious strength is doing well. You admit you cannot deal with any of this. I think most reasonable people would concede that I have a point. Click to expand... Your definition of reasonable thinks that Sarkozy is leaving France to avoid taxes by moving to the UK who has in many ways a worse tax system and that the police raids and his removal of immunity have nothing to do with his plans. Your definition of reasonable is completely screwed up. In other words, if you survey a country in which a person would get his head chopped off if he admits to being an atheist there is good reason to believe that the figures are not going to be accurate and should not be compared to figures from countries that practice tolerance of belief. How about Saudi Arabia or the UAE? Really rich people with high levels of religiosity, right? However, I'll resist the temptation to claim that this supports the American data because it would be bogus to do so. Click to expand... Saudi Arabia is a poor country. The wealth is stacked in the elites with the elites buying off the masses. Actual per capita income in Saudi Arabia is quite low when you remove handouts. IF you bothered to do any research rather then just assuming whatever the hell you want, you'd knows this. The Saudi Monarchy enacted a massive welfare scheme right at the time Egypt was going down to prevent an Arab Spring in their backyard. And the UAE is a poor nation too. You are assuming everyone enjoys the wealth of those who live in Dubai. That is not the case. In many ways, UAE is worse then Saudi Arabia. Non-hydrocarbons make up small portions of their economy. Take out those and both nations quickly have little to show for their economies. Both survive largely because of hydrocarbon exports. Tell me how that's related to religion. Try. Nope, I have the facts that lend my argument support. You have refused to even acknowledge that much. Click to expand... What facts? You have cited little more then your own opinions. Sorry, but the Sarkozy thread was no failure on my part. There again you grasped on irrelevant facts and crowed loudly that it trashed my argument and accused me of being dishonest, but it did not and I was not. Even ThinkProgress centered on Sarkozy's desire to escape taxes as the main point. Click to expand... The thread failure is entirely your fault. And you were highly dishonest there.

Here is that data I offered, in case people have forgotten, and you do seem to have forgotten: (Some of the figures I read off of graphs, so they may not be exactly right.) Click to expand...

Burwell argue that people who buy coverage on the federal exchange are not entitled to subsidies. (Consumers in the 16 states and the District of Columbia that set up their own insurance exchanges would not be affected.) The Obama administration argues that Congress intended to help everyone who qualifies for it. The court is expected to issue its ruling by the end of the month."}

Yes, it was regrettable and, if caught, the individuals are being \"sent back home\" or jailed if they have no identity papers. Germany is far, far more concerned with the ISIS attacks today. The EU is totally responsible for the Mass Migration, which, it seems, happened spontaneously, and has since exploded disproportionately in the media. There is no rampant raping going on here, unless that being hyped by the media for selling newspapers. At least that's what one serious analysis of the relevant data seems to say, here . Excerpt: The New Year's Eve attacks upon women in Cologne, Germany and the subsequent allegations against male migrants across Europe brings to light an important question. Are European women in danger from an influx of Middle Eastern men with different social, religious and legal values? Using available data on rates of immigration and sexual violence, and focusing specifically on Germany and Sweden, we show that there is no direct correlation between foreign migrant influx and national rape statistics in the two identified case studies. Based on these conclusions, we then ask, why have the attacks in Germany and Sweden gained so much media attention and resulted in rising hostility toward refugees. To address this question, we examine theories of women and nationalism, and the rhetorical use of the specter of rape to mobilize the masses. We conclude by theorizing that if concern for women's rights is only used as fodder for the flame against admitting refugees, the EU will both lose the crucial opportunity to prepare for future influxes of migrants and fall prey to dangerous ethnic divisions.

The love of God provided that somebody else pay for our sins to spare us that penalty. And that person was… 3. …no less than God Himself.” Click to expand... Reasonable enough. I’m not entirely clear what you’re saying here. If you’re saying that people have to willingly decide for themselves to accept Christ as Lord & Savior and that decision is up to them, then I agree. Click to expand... Let me try a parallel. If you are hanging from the side of the cliff and are in danger of falling off, and cannot pull yourself up, you still have to make the effort to grab the hand of your savior in order to be saved. To maintain the parallel to Christ, he only offers you his hand. He will not grab your wrist if you slip or let go. It is up to you to take that hand. It's a two way road of action, albeit with Christ shouldering most of the work. Accepting the rescue and not taking the hand is not enough. As far as the Inquisition goes, I’m not comfortable calling it “Christian history” as a Christian should never do such a thing. I think of it more in terms of “Church history” or “Catholic history”. People should understand that nowhere in the Bible does it ever argue for, condone or excuse the evil of the Inquisition. Click to expand... As much as it pains me we have to accept this as part of Christian history as well. We don't have to accept it as part of the example of Christ. Without acknowledging and accepting these breakdowns in our history we are doomed to stray again and again as a congregation. Let me try and rephrase this to see if I can get you “on-board”. When someone becomes a “Christian”, there should be an outward change in behavior. We should expect that a change in a belief system would bring about a change in behavior. I do accept that immediately after becoming a Christian someone’s understanding of Christianity may be very immature and would naturally grow over time. My point is simply that of the Apostle James when he said that faith without works is dead (James 2:17). Better? Click to expand... Your argument works will with the \"born again\" where they come to Christ in their later life. And I will acknowledge that one can attend Sunday School and Church since they day they were born and never really accept Christ till in their adult years. However, that does not mean that there are not those who have truly accepted him throughout their lives even while not comprehending on an intellectual level what and why they are doing it. Think of driving a car. You can do it perfectly well while not really understanding why your actions result in certain reactions, positive or negative (speaking on the mechanical/electrical internal level). You could then discover why certain mechanical principles work, but it doesn't necessarily affect how you drive. Likewise, a child can be managed to be brought up accepting Christ their whole life. They have no moment in their life to bring about a change in behavior. It remains spiritually consistent. Are you saying because they are already where they should be without a changing moment they aren't Christians? Actually, I’m pretty sure it was the Jews. They’re the ones who wrote it. Click to expand... Well I guessed it could be argued a couple different ways. After all Jesus himself was a Jew. All of his followers, including Mathew, Mark Luke and John, not to mention Paul were all Jews as well. So at what point do the followers of Christ (historically speaking, not individually) go from Jews to Christians? The Jews indeed wrote the books that make up the Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament. But I would say that it was Christians (followers of Christ) that wrote the books of the New Testament. And it was the Catholic Church that brought many of these books together into what they called the Bible. The original Bible consisted of many books not found in protestant (vice Protestant) Bibles and also were gathered together in the Apocrypha. The bible is literally an anthology and not a \"book\" in and of itself. So it was Paul's church, the one that survived and dominated over the churches of the other apostles, that first gathered up all the books and printed them into a single bound volume. Paul's church is the one that is currently known as the Catholic church. Therefore the Catholics are the ones who originated the Bible. I think you lost me. Are you talking about the Catholic Bible? Click to expand... Summing up the above again, the Catholic bible is the original. They were the first to gather up the various books into a single volume, therefore if there are any changes, additions or omissions those come from the protestant denominations that sprang up later. That’s one of the problems I have with the Catholic faith. Click to expand... Catholics are not the only ones with this fault. Many denominations also follow the \"follow our interpretation\" model and discourage their congregations from really reading the bible."}

Knorr, did not play the role of prophet, under his administration Fred W. Franz (his vice president) did issue a prediction. In his book, Life Everlasting in Freedom of the Sons of God, published in 1966, Franz wrote that it would be “appropriate” and “most fitting” for Jesus to begin His millennial reign in 1975 (which would mark the end of 6,000 years of human history). He said: “...it would not be by mere chance or accident but according to the loving purpose of Jehovah God for the reign of Jesus Christ...to run parallel with the seventh millennium of man’s existence” (as quoted in Franz, 1983, p. 61). Although this prediction was worded cautiously, the point was clear enough that the Jehovah’s Witnesses looked forward to 1975 with tremendous expectation. That year passed, of course, as had 1914 and 1925. The prophecy failed, and disillusionment gripped several hundred thousand Jehovah’s Witnesses who subsequently abandoned the Watch Tower (Chretien, 1988). Mr. Franz served as president of the Watch Tower from 1977 until his death in 1991. He, like his predecessors, failed the decisive test of a prophet: “If the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously” (Deuteronomy 18:22).

The NYTimes published a news article that ignited “a national discussion about race and law enforcement unfolded after the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard’s prominent scholar of African-American history. Professor Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct July 16 at his home in Cambridge, Mass., as the police investigated a report of a possible break-in there. The charge was later dropped, and the Cambridge Police Department said the incident was “regrettable and unfortunate.” President Obama said the police officer had acted stupidly. I claim that both the policeman and the professor had made moral decisions of the highest meaning. Both made decisions affecting the interrelationships of the community in its widest variables. The Scientific Method seeks to bracket [fence out] meaningfulness. The scientific method hates bias and bias is one form of meaning. Bias causes the individual to often distort “truth”. In the lab bias is the enemy, i.e. meaning is the enemy. Religion seeks to bracket the word “morality”, i.e. to create a fence protecting the “word” from outside influence. Religion seeks to bracket human critical thought. I was raised as a Catholic and went to Catholic schools and was taught by nuns. I learned quickly that to “entertain” impure thoughts (thoughts about sex) or questions about my religion were sinful and had to be confessed to a priest in the confessional. What is meaning? Meaning is not a thing: meaning is a creatures’ association with an object. Meaning and epistemology (what can we know and how can we know it) go together like a “horse and carriage”. Epistemology is about comprehension and comprehension is about meaning. Comprehension can be usefully thought of as being hierarchical and formed like a pyramid. At the base is awareness followed by consciousness. Awareness is the beginning of comprehension; it begins with preconceptual and unconscious happenings in our brain. Consciousness adds to awareness the focus of our attention on this object that results from awareness. We are aware of much and we are conscious of little. When I walk in the woods I am aware of much and become quickly terrified by the consciousness of a shape that makes me think bear. Knowing follows consciousness on this pyramid. Knowing is followed by understanding. Understanding is at the pinnacle of the pyramid of comprehension. Meaning follows comprehension side by side. Meaning begins with awareness and grows with consciousness and knowing. At the pinnacle of the pyramid is the creation of new meaning through the process of our understanding, which organizes into a gestalt that which is known. The understanding at the pinnacle of comprehension is that rare moment of eureka when all becomes clear after a great struggle to understand a complex matter. Understanding is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle where our knowledge are the pieces of the puzzle."}

Our society is built to make laws based on what most folks would have, with the caveat that rights trump laws, so it isn't just about a vote. This isn't a perfect mechanism, but is probably the best we can do. I agree for example that gay marriage should be ok in society. Society isn't Christ. It's not a Christian problem.

Yes, I agree the Christians in this small Virginia town (24,000 pop.) do need \"to get over themselves.\" The offended ones , seemed to be a minority even in Augusta County, VA - \" About 100 people came to a forum \" WHY are they being so sensitive ? No public High School should be teaching a class on Comparative Religion. The only reason it's being done is the adults running the asylum have some twisted belief it will make the students more compliant and aware. What a waste of time. Click to expand... I think that it is a positive that you are in the minority on the question of teaching about non-Christian religions. As noted in a Washington Post article on this kerfuffle, this specific lesson - the calligraphy of the shahada , has been part of the curriculum at the school in question for approximately twenty years. No controversy over the years but because of the paranoia induced by certain political figures and talking heads in the media - now, a lesson teaching about Islam has become \"MUSLIM INDOCTRINATION!!!!\" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the controversy in Augusta County is “symptomatic of the hysterical anti-Muslim bigotry that we’re seeing in America at this current time. “Anything to do with Islam or Muslims somehow becomes controversial, and you get this knee-jerk reaction based on misinformation, stereotypes, bias, and it’s really reaching frightening proportions,” Hooper said Click to expand... Why have so many Americans recently become adversaries of education? Why do so many believe , no thinking involved, that public education is little more \"liberal indoctrination\", a waste of their taxes and simply a way to give money to those who can't hold real jobs - teachers? Luckily for most American kids those trying to shut down public education are still in the minority - though they do seem to have grabbed the megaphone of public debate from the more rational among us. “To be an educated person, to be a citizen, to be part of the global conversation, to be engaged in our world, religious literacy is essential,” said Charles C. Haynes, vice president of the Newseum Institute and founding director of the Religious Freedom Center. “More important than that is how are we going to live with one another in one of the most religiously diverse societies in the world without understanding one another?” Click to expand..."}

Click to expand... So? What's your point? This doesn't change the fact that you lied, jack. moe said: Your argument that things only exist in the mind is true but not in the way that you try to present it. ALL things connected to human society are nothing but an extension of our collective minds. We manifest our thoughts intentions ideas and ideals mentally physically and spiritually. If all humanity were to disappear then all our accumulated wisdom, philosophy etc would disappear with us. All terminology, definitions etc would disappear because without us they do not exist. Click to expand... This has no bearing on anything that you are claiming. It seems to be a red herring. It is up to you to prove that absolute morals exist. Can you or can't you do this? moe said: Our Scriptures teach us that we humans are created in the image of God. We can say the same thing about society and ourselves. We have created it in our own image. We are the substance and our society is the reflection of us. Remove the substance and the reflection cannot exist on its own. It no longer has any substance or meaning Click to expand... Who cares? Without appealing to your brainwashing and dogma, DEMONSTRATE how absolute morals exist, or admit that you have no argument. moe said: A house, a car, a skyscraper, up down, sideways, backwards, these are terms that only exist in our minds. Only we humans recognize these items by their assigned terms. Again if something were to happen to all humanity at once who would be around to say that is a house. That is a car. It is only a house or a car as long as there is at least one human to actually recognize it as such. These are all human terms and have nothing to do with true reality but only in reality as we perceive it. Click to expand... You're conflating issue again and it's wearing down my patience. I'm about to decide that you don't have the necessary acumen to be discussing this issue at all. A house that is there, exists, whether or not there exists a term for it or not. The same for a horse, an atom, a baseball, whatever. CONCEPTS such as numbers and morals don't exist like a horse or a baseball, but ONLY as philosophical constructs that help us negotiate with the world around us and our social networks. When you can prove that morals or absolute morals exist, then you'll have something. moe said: Basically as an atheist you are limited. Click to expand... And as a theist, you're limited, and in my opinion far more so than me. moe said: You believe in only what you can see. You think that if something does not have a touchable surface it cannot exist. And yet you cannot touch a thought, an idea. You cannot touch it until a human manifests that idea into something that you can in some way perceive. Click to expand... FAIL I believe in all sorts of things i can't see. Being an atheist ONLY means that i don't believe in god. That i'm an atheist means nothing about what i believe or don't believe other than when it comes to god. moe said: Moral absolutes/standards are physically manifested in the body of laws that govern a society. Click to expand... No, they aren't. The concepts are deemed valid by our interaction with them and how they help us govern ourselves. They don't prove their existence. Math would be a lost art without numbers, but math doesn't prove that numbers actually exist somewhere. They are simply concepts. Concepts like morals and numbers help us tremendously, but that doesn't mean that they exist in any real sense. They exist as concepts, and that's why they're so cool and useful. moe said: The letter of the law is absolute. Click to expand... No. It changes all the time depending on all sorts of factors. I think that you may not know what \"absolute\" means. moe said: It does not care if there was a justifiable reason or not. It just is. Our courts tend to operate upon situational ethics which is the spirit of the law. Thus a person may not receive the full punishment of the letter of the law or may even be acquitted if their circumstances were truly dire. Click to expand... >sigh< And the law allows and demands those interpreters as it can't go around doing things on it's own. Thus, the law CERTAINLY DOES CARE about the justifications of actions. Duh. Here's an excellent chance for you to learn. The physical laws (say, gravity) don't care about intent. So what that you only intended to step from the ladder to the roof? What does the law of gravity care? Do you see? Now, compare the physical laws to our humanly constructed laws to govern morals in our society. You kill someone, and the law does nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero. It takes an AGENT of the law (police officer) to come and punish you for breaking the humanly constructed code. The agent of the human law comes and delivers what some other body (the court) determines is a righteous retribution. Do you see the difference between those two categories of \"law\"? If there were absolute morals, there'd be no agents necessary when those absolute morals were violated. Absolute morals wouldn't be in question because they'd be obvious to everyone. The fact that there is debate about what morals are good and bad is itself evidence that morals are constructed, and not physical, actual items in existence. moe said: So just because you lack the ability to perceive something, Or refuse to accept something because you do not agree with it or any other reason does not mean it does not exist. As long as we exist. It exists. Click to expand... And the fact that you keep repeating what you cannot demonstrate doesn't make it true. You're like a parrot who won't learn. You keep saying the same statement over and over while denying that you have nothing but the sound of your own words. You can't demonstrate one word of what you say, and that makes your words nothing but a hollow gong or a clanging cymbal. Teh proof is in the pudding. Where's your bowl and spoon? moe said: If you do not believe this then try a test yourself. Go out and break any law you chose and when you arrive in court explain to them that by your personal moral code you have broken no laws. Tell them you have been to a university and have studied these things. Moe Click to expand... What will that prove? I'll tell you. The only thing that that would prove is that the laws (constructed by humans and adhered to by humans in my society) keep them fairly vigilantly. Yes, numbers work because we all agree that the integer 1 means \"one\". Yes, our moral codes work because the society that manufactures them holds the individuals in that society to them. The moral agents that work for the law do their best to hold citizens to that law. This proves MY POINT and MY REBUTTALS and does NOTHING for you points or your assertions. I'll grant you this: If there are absolute morals, then like gravity they're unbreakable, and thus, we'd probably never know that those absolute morals exist. Either way, it's for you to prove (as the claimant) that absolute morals exist. So far, all you've done is hem and haw and repeat yourself. Why not try to do better?"}

What you are doing is picking some hippy peace loving form of christianity and comparing it to the most barbaric form of islam you can think of. Click to expand... To the contrary, I am evaluating the ideal worlds envisioned by Christianity and Islam by comparing the teachings and personal examples provided by the respective founders of these religions. If one belief system happens to have found its roots in the humble teachings of a common philosopher living in self-imposed poverty, where the other was based off of the gradiose musings of an up-jumped merchant turned tribal warlord, I am hardly to blame. The simple fact of the matter is that the \"hippy\" version of Christianity is precisely what Christ intended and practiced. Likewise, the \"barbaric\" version of Islam is exactly what Muhammed intended and practiced. You can spend an eternity quibbling around the particular details and \"shades of gray\" surrounding these facts, but it will not alter this inherent reality in the slightest. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that Christianity is not, nor has it ever been, the wholly negative influence on Western Civilization you seem to view it as. Christianity did not spread through the Roman Empire by means of violence and oppression. If anything, it was the target of violence and oppression and grew all the stronger because of this fact. Islam, by way of contrast, spread almost purely as a result of military conquest and forced conversion. Christianity also did not seek to tear down existing institutional power structures for its own gain. As a matter of fact, it preserved Roman science, learning, and law in the West after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and was responsible for re-establishing some degree of European order and central government in the chaos that followed. Conversion to Christianity granted otherwise disparate Germanic warlords a common ground from which they could relate to and engage one-another, and the subjugated peoples under them, in a more or less peaceful manner. This ultimately allowed the post-Roman political and social situation in Western Europe to stabilze under the fedual system. Islam might very well have held the same appeal to the handful of Arab tribes living in and around Mecca in the 7th Century, but afterwards, it was only ever interested in conquest and plunder. I will certainly grant you that (often times, only nominal) allegiance to Christianity did not in any way guarantee immunity from barbarism in Medieval Europe. However, you have to remember that the Middle Ages were an inherently barbaric time, and that secular rulers could not always be counted upon to to live up to the religious and moral codes to which they claimed to ascribe. This was not a failure of Christianity or the Church. The Church has always taught and practiced charity, and Popes routinely spoke out against, and even excommunicated, rulers who behaved in cruel and immoral ways. They also issued numerous edicts against the injustices they perceived in the world around them. The fact that these actions were often ignored by secular authorities no more invalidates Christianity than an indivual's choice to ignore their conscience invalidates the concept of moral behavior. It is also true that Christianity was subject to a considerable degree of corruption at certain points. However, this is honestly to be expected given the amount of power and influence the Christian Church held during the Medieval period. Power corrupts, unfortunately. This is just as true of religious leaders as it is the secular variety. However, it must be pointed out that this is ultimately a human, rather than religious, failing. In no way do the actions of a handful of corrupt men invalidate the philosophical core of the entire belief system to which they ascribe. In any case, I still maintain that the major difference here lies in the approach to life and morality the two religions were ultimately responsible for creating. Corrupt and murderous Christian lords and clergymen living in opulent splendour while their people starved were actually acting against the teachings of their faith. This was reflected in the cultural movements which rose up to correct these injustices. Bloodthirsty Islamic sultans basking in every decadent luxury imaginable were not, and so no such impulse to reform social systems ever arose. I firmly believe that these inherent differences played a major role in the West's ultimate ascension and the Middle East's decline. As for the matter of being religious of peace both religions are using Orwellian doublespeak in claiming to be religions of peace. Both claim they are against violence and then go on to introduce a litany of exceptions to their so called absolute law of peace. Click to expand... There really is no doublespeak where Christianity is concerned. The text is quite clear. The text is also quite clear where Islam is concerned. \"Modern\" muslims simply have a tendency not to want to accept this fact, as the text in question tends to play quite poorly with modern audiences."}

This year, however, they've started a bold new experiment that grew out of that experience: putting hospitals on a fixed budget. By letting hospitals know upfront at the start of the year how much revenue they've got to work with (and holding them accountable for quality outcomes) the normal incentive structure has been turned on its head. Global budgets pushing Maryland hospitals to target population health The new clinic is one example of innovative strategies Maryland hospitals are employing to improve population health and reduce costs under their state's unique new global budget revenue, or GBR, program. State officials negotiated the program with the CMS Innovation Center and launched it last January, moving the state toward paying healthcare providers based on improving population health rather than on volume of services. Other hospitals are launching similar initiatives to keep their patient populations healthier. . . “It has literally, overnight, changed the hospital business model 180 degrees,” said Carmela Coyle, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association. “It is now in the hospitals' economic interest to keep people well and out of the hospital.” The GBR system has led to more collaboration and trust between hospitals and insurers because their financial incentives now are aligned, said Scott Furniss, senior vice president and chief financial officer at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore. “There's a whole new level of opportunity,” he said. Now, when insurance officials propose strategies for reducing utilization, the hospital will invite them over to discuss it. “Historically, I would have thought, 'What are they up to? Probably less revenue for me,' ” Furniss said. Click to expand... Hospitals have started changing the way they do business to better impact the total health of their patients--not just when those patients show up in inpatient settings but when they're out in their communities as well. One of the examples they give in that article is a hospital that built a small clinic on-site at a low-income apartment complex full of hospital \"frequent fliers\" so to speak. By helping those patients manage their conditions at home and shifting low-intensity care they may need to a more appropriate (and cheaper) setting, the hospital's investment will pay off for it under Maryland's new system. Ultimately, it's a whole new way of doing business: Providers increasingly are looking at community-based initiatives to improve health. The Bon Secours Community Works program in West Baltimore, sponsored by the Bon Secours Baltimore Health System, addresses social determinants of health. Projects include economic revitalization, parenting classes, job training, pre-school classes, community vegetable gardens and eviction-prevention workshops. “Our approach has been holistic,” said Sister Patricia Dowling, president of the Community Works board of directors. “The need in the community drives what happens—like when the only bank in the area left, we brought in a credit union.” . . . The hospital association's Coyle said the state's health information exchange system, the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, known as CRISP, is aiding population health-management efforts. All 46 of Maryland's acute-care hospitals participate in the exchange, as do more than 150 medical practices. “If you want to manage the health of a population, you have to know who your superusers are, where they live and what they need.” St. Agnes has made a number of care-delivery changes in response to the new GBR system. It has hired navigators to work with patients before and after discharge to make sure they see a primary-care doctor within seven days and fill their prescriptions. The hospital is working on delivering patients' medications to their bedside prior to discharge. Even though the hospital is not paid for these care-coordination services, this could save the hospital money by reducing readmissions. Doctors Community Hospital, in Lanham, Md., has identified patients who frequently needed emergency care and opened facilities tailored to them. It launched free clinics for congestive heart failure and COPD patients, offering four-week educational programs to teach them how to manage their conditions. There is also a clinic for sickle-cell anemia patients—a population with a high readmission rate. Camille Bash, the hospital's chief financial officer, said the readmission rate for sickle-cell patients has dropped from about 33% to 10% or less. . . “Reimbursement was volume-driven,” she said. “We have swung back because we have shifted the focus to doing the right things.” Click to expand..."}

So many words and all that to make the ridiculous claim that insurers have an interest in reducing the cost of medical care. . .You seem to forget that insurance companies make their money based on a percentage of total cash handled. Click to expand... You talk as though premium increases can be passed along without limit--in reality, the existence of a well-functioning market (for the first time in many places around the country) puts severe constraints on that. In other words, the days of insurers doing nothing to contain costs, concealing their inaction inside ever-increasing premiums, are coming to a close. In a competitive market, the incentive is to keep premiums as low as possible to avoid losing current or potential customers to competitors. But if there's downward pressure on premium growth, then insurers have an incentive to keep their enrolled population as healthy as possible to avoid unnecessary outlays. Under the old system (built around individual rating), cost-shifting was the name of the game as insurers were incentivized to be as creative as possible in avoiding risk (skimping on benefits, turning away customers, etc). Just as medical services effectively have no particular price since every insurer pays a different amount for them, under individual rating insurance products had no particular premium. Each prospective plan would have to individually rate a shopper, making side-by-side comparisons virtually impossible even before you factor in the reality that there weren't standardized products or plan designs to even compare. That's a system that tilts heavily in the direction of insurers (it's opaque and almost entirely at their discretion) and historically it's provided virtually no check on premium growth and no incentive for insurers to attack the underlying cost drivers affecting the health care system. Premiums in the individual market routinely grew at 10% per year or more under the old system. Under the new system, it's indisputable at this point that insurers are doing everything they can to put the brakes on rising costs. And that's because under community rating/guaranteed issue in a competitive market (vs. individual rating in a fragmented, opaque \"market\") their incentives switch from risk evasion to cost control. And we're seeing it in lots of ways, from tighter provider networks aimed at keeping provider reimbursement rates down (excluding the highest priced providers or, for the first time, bargaining them down to reasonable rates) to broader population health management strategies. Again, there's no doubt that this happening. For instance, 2014 marketplace premiums were up to 20% (!) cheaper than comparable plans (in terms of covered benefits and plan generosity) in the employer space. { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded.

More Competition Helps Restrain Premiums In Federal Health Marketplace A surge in health insurer competition appears to be helping restrain premium increases in hundreds of counties next year, with prices dropping in many places where newcomers are offering the least expensive plans, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of federal premium records. . . In counties that are adding at least one insurer next year, premiums for the least expensive silver plan are rising 1 percent on average. Click to expand... Heather Kane, United’s vice president for exchange strategy, said many of United’s plans are HMOs with smaller networks of doctors and hospitals than what United offers through its employer plans. Kane said United structured its new plans after studying which policies from competitors were most popular. “Consumers voted for affordability,” she said. Click to expand... With downward pressure on premiums through market competition (a novelty!), that means insurers have to scramble to keep the costs of the care they're paying for down. An approach I suspect will rely heavily on 1) smarter benefit design (pushing shopper toward high-value services and providers), 2) active population health management to not only preserve health but address deficiencies in the health care delivery system that drive up spending, and 3) more selective provider contracting/network design to attack price growth growth. Those strategies together attack both pieces of the cost equation, unjustifiably high prices for health care services and unnecessary inefficiencies and services due to a poorly organized delivery system. This isn't your parents' insurance market--nor health care system. We're entering a whole new era where not only do more people have coverage, the incentives are actually starting to point in the right direction to improve health and keep cost growth down."}

When it comes to the individual market, the health insurance industry is in the midst of a bit of a renaissance. Formerly, when faced with rising costs they relied on a handful of options, such as: 1) cutting benefits, 2) culling the sick and expensive, 3) acquiescing and hiding behind the opacity of the old market. Now these options are no longer available. A benefits floor protects consumers, risk adjustment eliminates most of the advantage of devising clever strategies to make the sick someone else's problem, and the marketplace is a lot more simple and transparent than it used to be. As I've mentioned previously, the primary strategies for getting a handle on costs now are likely to be things like: 1) smarter benefit design, 2) active population health management (working to keep people healthy ), 3) more selective network development, and 4) more frugal negotiated reimbursement rates with providers. Now they're starting to use those tools. Here we have examples of options (2) and (3) (at least) from Iowa's dominant insurer, which is launching a new product that aspires to be cheaper by being better. A novel concept! Wellmark offers health incentives in new plans First, they're exploring ways to emphasize health promotion and keep their enrollees healthy: Iowa’s largest health-insurer will soon offer gift cards and fitness bracelets to members who participate in wellness efforts under a new set of insurance plans. Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield is teaming with the UnityPoint Health system and Hy-Vee pharmacies to provide the “Blue Rewards” plans. Members will face smaller co-pays and deductibles if they obtain care at UnityPoint clinics and hospitals and if they have prescriptions filled at Hy-Vees than if they go to other providers. The plans will offer Hy-Vee gift cards of up to $100 and other rewards, such as FitBit bracelets, to members who do things such as select a primary care doctor, get an annual physical exam and talk to a dietitian. Members also can earn points by signing up to have Wellmark documents sent electronically instead of by mail. Click to expand... Second, they're working on pointing enrollees toward smarter, more affordable care that's provided by a provider network that can coordinate care to avoid the waste that's prevalent in our system. Tiered networks give enrollees a reasonably broad choice of providers, but they steer folks toward the highest value providers by making the co-pays lower for them than for other in-network providers. The plans will be offered in 31 Iowa counties, including Polk and all of its neighbors. The Blue Rewards plans have “tiered networks” of providers, which are increasingly common in health insurance. Members will pay significantly higher copays and deductibles if they use clinics and pharmacies outside the primary networks. The amounts vary by plan, but they could amount to thousands of dollars in extra charges per year. Wellmark Vice President Laura Jackson said her company hopes to enroll at least several thousand Iowans in the Blue Rewards plans, which are being sold to individuals and small businesses and will start taking effect Jan. 1. More than 300 employers and 200 individuals have already asked for price quotes, she said. “That’s really good early interest.” She said premiums on the new plans will generally be $30 to $50 cheaper per month than her company’s standard plans. The main selling point should be that the insurer, Hy-Vee and UnityPoint will be working together to provide care, she said. Click to expand... Wellmark is also notable for having embraced an accountable care organization strategy (that's been piggybacked upon by Iowa's Medicaid program) to start getting costs in line: Wellmark reports improved quality and cost savings from its Accountable Care Organizations arrangements DES MOINES, IA (Aug. 7, 2014) – The five initial Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) participating in Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s ACO Shared Savings model have improved their quality scores by over 35 percent and saved more than $12 million during the first two years, Wellmark announced today. The positive results mean that each of the initial five participating ACOs will receive an incentive payment from Wellmark for achieving their performance goals. “In collaboration with providers, we are working together to transform health care in Iowa from a system that has emphasized quantity of care to one that rewards quality of care while also improving the patient experience.” said Sheryl Terlouw, director, network innovation. “This is a good indication of the positive results that can be achieved when providers of care and Wellmark work together with a common focus on the patient.” ACOs are designed to improve the quality of care, provide greater value and slow increases in health care costs. ACO providers assume responsibility for managing a population of patients, both who are healthy and those who are in need of care, no matter where in the system the patients receive care. Wellmark offers the providers financial rewards if they reach established quality goals and slow the rate of increase in health care spending for these patients. At the same time, providers will not earn their incentives if their quality declines or their costs run higher than expected. Click to expand... Change is in the air!"}

And from $600 to $1000. Perhaps the cost of that hammer is increasing at the same rate as inflation. The next time this story is told it'll probably be about $1500. Ever since the Defense Department procurement scandals of the 1980s, the $600 hammer has been held up as an icon of Pentagon incompetence. Immortalized in the \"Hammer Awards\" that Vice President Al Gore's program to reinvent government gives out to waste-cutters, this absurdly overpriced piece of hardware has come to symbolize all that's wrong with the government's financial management. One problem: \"There never was a $600 hammer,\" said Steven Kelman, public policy professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a former administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. It was, he said, \"an accounting artifact.\" The military bought the hammer, Kelman explained, bundled into one bulk purchase of many different spare parts. But when the contractors allocated their engineering expenses among the individual spare parts on the list-a bookkeeping exercise that had no effect on the price the Pentagon paid overall-they simply treated every item the same. So the hammer, originally $15, picked up the same amount of research and development overhead-$420-as each of the highly technical components, recalled retired procurement official LeRoy Haugh. (Later news stories inflated the $435 figure to $600.) \"The hammer got as much overhead as an engine,\" Kelman continued, despite the fact that the hammer cost much less than $420 to develop, and the engine cost much more-\"but nobody ever said, 'What a great deal the government got on the engine!' \" Click to expand...

Well I agree that what has been offered points this way. As I have said I'm an Anglican Catholic and must generally bow to Church traditions and teaching and I don't think they agree. But anyway the point is that any of these people in authority must have their own autonomy and sphere of authority for this authority to be meaningful. Therefore iF another type of authority invades this sphere then it is disrespecting their authority and one could say \"the powers that be\". This would, using just our own reading of those passages, allow resistance to say a gov't that did interfere in these spheres of authority such as if it interfered too much with the authority of the parent over the child.

Calculating what the government COULD take from me.. doesn't mean that when it doesn't take from me.. that somehow, the government is paying me. (see above regarding the your philosophy) We've had the discussion many times. Problems valuing a benefit doesn't mean there is no benefit, and doesn't affect what the benefit represents. If Sue and Jaeger and JasperL all paid identical costs for that policy, it doesn't change the \"subsidy?\" or \"NOT-subsidy?\" conclusion. Click to expand... Actually yes it does change the subsidy not subsidy conclusion. OK, so you kept wages low so the workers would qualify for a crap policy, but are worried about the effect on workers who enjoy benefits nearly twice the national average? Why doesn't that make sense to me? Click to expand... Why doesn't it make sense to you? I fought hard in those discussions to provide better wages to our employees.. to attract better employees and make more money. And I understand the underlying inefficiency of what the other vice presidents and ceo were arguing for. We don't pay wages and the employees then get Medicaid... sounds great except we pay more in taxes to the government.. the government then turns around and provides Medicaid which sucks and doesn't give us a competitive advantage. It makes way more sense to simply pay better wages, and provide benefits. (which is why by the way single payer and things like the excise tax make no sense). The worst thing about the excise tax is not only does the employee get screwed over in their insurance.. but then no one else benefits either.. all it does is lower the quality of health insurance for people. I agree with that. Where is the bill that will do that? How much does it cost and when can we expect the GOPers to introduce this fantastic plan? Click to expand... Well.. lets start by getting rid of the excise tax that makes it harder to provide insurance and hurts middle class and lower working folks. When you are in a hole.. the first thing you have to do to get out of it.. is to stop digging."}

Like I said, that's actually OK with me, but of course what you're doing is protecting benefits at the very top of the scale and while doing nothing for the people who have real problems accessing healthcare. I'm fine with trading unlimited subsidies for health benefits costing $100,000 or more per year for a fortunate small minority for better access at the bottom. Whatever it takes. It's how legislation normally gets through Congress - protect the rich and they'll let some crumbs fall down to the poor."}

One reason: some insurers who largely took a pass to watch in year one are now getting off the sidelines. UnitedHealth Seeks to Sell Health-Exchange Policies in 24 States - WSJ UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH +0.01% has applied to sell plans in 24 states' health-law consumer marketplaces next year, including major markets such as Texas and Pennsylvania. The company's insurance arm, which is the biggest U.S. insurer by number of people covered, had previously said it would expand to \"as many as two dozen\" states' individual-plan exchanges. Its moves are being closely watched by competitors and analysts, partly because the insurer's footprint will grow so much. This year, UnitedHealthcare sold health-law plans in just four states. Jeff Lucht, a senior vice president at UnitedHealthcare who oversees its public exchange strategy, said that in addition to Texas and Pennsylvania, the new states are expected to include Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Among the other new states are Michigan, Georgia, Indiana and Ohio, according to a list compiled by analyst Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank. The four states where UnitedHealthcare currently sells exchange plans are New York, Nevada, Maryland and Colorado. UnitedHealthcare chose the new markets based on \"a combination of the growth opportunity...and the extent to which we thought we could offer a competitive product in the market,\" Mr. Lucht said. The insurer will use a variety of plan designs, including health-maintenance organizations, Mr. Lucht said, and will focus on keeping premiums down: \"Consumers voted, and that vote was that they really valued affordability,\" he said. Still, UnitedHealthcare's pricing will aim to cover costs and achieve a positive margin, he said. Click to expand..."}

An appointed- CEO, CFO, and 9 member board of directors. The 72 student Congress will be voted on by the students within each of the six degree programs. For example the freshman class in the math/science degree program would elect three representatives, the sophomore class will do the same, etc. All voluntary, no salary. The 48 member Senate will be voted in from the following way: the parents in the freshman math/science degree program will vote in one parent senator from among them, the sophomore class the same, etc, for a total of 24. The freshman math/science students will vote for one teacher, the sophomore class the same, etc, for a total of 24 from all six degree programs. The teachers vote will only count as 1/2 vote on any legislation, giving the parents the ultimate power. The subcommittees of the Congress/Senate will work together to find the best companies for each degree program. For example the science/math degree program for 9th grade students will have 1 teacher senator, 1 parent senator, and 3 student congressional representatives working together along with the other 10th, 11th, 12th grade senators and representatives in the degree program. The student congress will keep the pulse of the students in each of the degree programs, what they are happy with, what they don't like, improvements that can be made. They will make suggestions on what educational companies they would like to see hired in each of the six degree programs. The 48 person Senate works with and advises the student Congress and votes whether to pass the Congress' suggestions. The Senate, besides ultimately choosing the six companies to run the degree programs, will also select an educational company to manage the school. For example they may choose Khan Academy. The selected managing company, in this example Khan Academy, will appoint the CEO(President), and also a CFO(Vice President). These will be very well trained, talented individuals, and have salaries in the $150,000 and $100,000 range. A 9 member board of directors will be created, also non salaried. The student Congress will have one seat on the board chosen from among its members, the Senate will have two seats with one going to a teacher and one a parent among its members. Then each of the six degree program companies that are hired will provide a teacher for the school to not only teach in the classroom and expertise on implementing their company's curriculum but also fill a seat in the remaining six seats on the board of directors. The CEO, CFO, and 9 person board will run and manage the school. Total freedom to budget, hire, fire, give raises to great teachers, innovate, etc."}

It's no secret that the (historically inefficient, short-sighted, and wasteful) way care is delivered has started to change under the ACA's incentives. We know the sticks in the ACA's Medicare reforms caught their attention : In site visits and interviews conducted for our ongoing qualitative research, the Center for Studying Health System Change found strong provider interest in payment reform and efforts to prepare for it, with the prospect of increasing constraint on Medicare payment rates cited as motivation. Click to expand... And : Shifting services from the inpatient to outpatient setting is just one way in which hospitals are changing their care and business models in reaction to recently implemented policies . Under the ACA, hospitals will have 8% of their Medicare revenues at risk by 2017, including penalties for hospital readmissions and hospital-acquired infections for those with the highest rates. Recent evidence has shown that providers have begun to move in a positive direction in regards to these measures. Since 2011, hospital readmissions have declined by approximately 10%. Click to expand... Value-based purchasing of hospital services has had a significant impact on hospital behavior. Hospitals are highly sensitive to changes in financial incentives. Movement away from a preponderance of fee-for-service payments is also likely to permanently alter hospital behavior. For instance, emphasis on reduced readmissions has reportedly changed how hospital managers think about care delivery, from the care delivered within their four walls towards coordinating care outside their four walls as they track patients as they return to the community or to various post acute care settings. Click to expand... We know the carrots in the ACA's Medicare reforms have spurred action : Under an ACA program, the federal government gives money to hospitals that deliver better care , rather than just paying them for procedures covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Called the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, it aims to increase quality care and shrink the number of patients who die from mistakes. As part of the program, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pays hospitals for infection prevention, successful surgeries, low readmission rates and patient satisfaction scores. The CMS bases funding on both achievement and yearly improvement. Click to expand... Hospitals across the country are taking steps to improve and claim the extra funds. Mayo Clinic branches in Rochester, N.Y., Jacksonville and at the Scottsdale/Phoenix campus use iPads for cardiac surgery patients to help them track progress and to give them to-do lists for the day, says Douglas Wood, a cardiologist and director of Mayo's Center for Innovation. New York City's Beth Israel Medical Center and the Charleston Area Medical Center in West Virginia are among the hospitals that use the Ornish Spectrum, a 72-hour program for heart disease patients that helps them make lifestyle changes in nutrition, fitness and stress management. It was founded by physician and author Dean Ornish. Virginia hospitals in the Sentara Healthcare network allow patients to see their medical records on an app called MyChart. The app lets patients e-mail their doctors with questions, says Tim Jennings, Sentara's vice president of pharmacy services. [...] Quality care doesn't have to be high-tech. Staffers at Saint Elizabeth Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., removed regular soda from vending machines and moved diet soda and sugary drinks to the bottom rows to promote healthier choices, which can lower readmission, says Libby Raetz, vice president of nursing. Click to expand... And of course it isn't just the financial incentives (sticks and carrots) that are spurring the change, the ACA is also providing the technical assistance and know-how health care providers need to implement changes that improve care: Hospitals aren't changing only because there's a financial reward but because the government tells them how to make improvements, says Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and patient safety at the American Hospital Association. \"They are responding to that signal that says, 'Here is an important opportunity to do something that will make a difference,' \" Foster says. Click to expand... There's no question that there are major structural changes underway now under the ACA that are pushing and helping providers to deliver better care while slowing cost growth (at this point the ACA's accountable care organizations are directly serving at least 10% of the Medicare population, as well as over 30 million non-Medicare folks). More than 50,000 health care providers are participating in initiatives launched by the ACA-created CMS Innovation Center. Change is happening and the pace is only quickening."}

Click to expand... No ****. By which you mean he thought it was appropriate you continue not to act on your homosexual attractions? I just don't buy the \"I can't sexually access the people I want to, and that means I must die.\" argument. Click to expand... What is the matter with you anti gay people? This has **** to do with sexual accesses. Simply being attracted to the same sex is a homosexual act. The only way to stop that is to cease to be. Read the part off Matthew where Jesus explains what adultery is. Christians that don't know **** about the bible really piss me off. You are defining a church that has a wild variety of items in terms of how it approaches the narrow issue of your sexuality. Click to expand... I live with my husband who was thrown out of his home by his parents and told never to return at 18 then when he needed his church to help instead of opening their arms to him with Christ's love, they excommunicated him. In the time he needed them the most they told him to drop dead. Sorry, that isn't any church of Christ. It's the church of Satan and the crucifix hanging above the alter is more of an effigy. That wasn't bad enough, they did the same damned thing to his little brother when he was twelve. It was worse for him. because he had to live in a group home until we could adopt him, a process that took 11 months. Sorry bud it's a God damned sex church. It's like saying that the only thing in the conservative movement is the flat tax people. If the only thing you have in life - if what defines your life - is strictly and only your sexuality, you've sold yourself cheap, dude. Agreeably it's a big part, but humans are so much better and more than just that part of us. Click to expand... No****, so why did the sex church. focus on just my sexually if our isn't the sex church? There is a lot more to people, I am a father, a police officer, a husband, a musician, a wood carver, I used to be a bit of a party guy. Having a kid to care for takes that or of you. I used to be a boy scout volunteer but that turned out to be a sex club. There is a lot more to me. I am kind, generous, I love my friends and my family. All the damned church saw was sex. So again, you ought to feel bad for your church. It's a \"sex church. I have since found other churches that aren't obsessed with sex and they were quite lovely. Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, church of Christ, MCC, so on. I don't need the sex churches, their don't serve God they worship sex, not interested, sorry. I have taken my family a couple of times but Evan and Chris were so deeply hurt the have difficulty with it. So we have a \"church\" of our hearts and our home. Others are invited. We have visited several of our neighbors, particularly an elderly lady down our street and even have prayed with her numerous times. Evan makes cookies, Chris cuts their grass. I don't need the box of sex obsessed lunatics looking down their noses at my family. because we are all men."}

Read the part off Matthew where Jesus explains what adultery is. Christians that don't know **** about the bible really piss me off. Click to expand... Jesus said if you commit adultery in your mind you've committed it in your heart. He's pretty clearly speaking to engaging in and indulging fantasy here, not \"simply being attracted\" to someone. Nor does that make me or Jesus \"anti-Gay\" in the identity sense. I live with my husband who was thrown out of his home by his parents and told never to return at 18 then when he needed his church to help instead of opening their arms to him with Christ's love, they excommunicated him. Click to expand... Which, if he insisted that they both open their arms to him and to his decision to reject their teachings , is also both biblical and the teachings of Christ: Matthew 18 said: 15 “If your brother or sister sins,[c] go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. 16 But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’[d] 17 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. Click to expand... In fact, had they chosen instead to do the thing that \"feels\" \"nice\" in today's society and enabled him, they would have, in fact, been worse off: ...6 “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 7 Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.... Click to expand... Teaching people that it's okay to just keep on, keepin' on is treated pretty harshly. In the time he needed them the most they told him to drop dead Click to expand... They told him to drop dead? ...Is this like your priest \"telling you to die\" - emotional hyperbole and feelings of anger and rejection maybe taking the place of simple or objective description of events? Sorry, that isn't any church of Christ. Click to expand... That's an interesting claim to make. When did Christ annoint you His avatar, that you can make that declaration? Sorry bud it's a God damned sex church. Click to expand... No, it is simply that you refuse to see it through anything other than the lense of your own experience which you see only through the lens of your sexuality. The Catholic church is also a massive charitable organization, historically preserved much of civilization for western society, faces down persecution in China, and is the largest body of Christians in the world today. No****, so why did the sex church. focus on just my sexually if our isn't the sex church? Click to expand... Probably because of things like Matthew 18 (see above). Had you gone in and insisted that they take both you and your ongoing and unrepentant drug habits, or career in the abortion industry, they would have been right to refuse to enable that as well. That wouldn't make them a church that was all about drugs or abortion, but it does make them a church that does not abandon their beliefs in order to make life easier. There is a lot more to people, I am a father, a police officer, a husband, a musician, a wood carver, I used to be a bit of a party guy. Having a kid to care for takes that or of you. I used to be a boy scout volunteer but that turned out to be a sex club. There is a lot more to me. I am kind, generous, I love my friends and my family. All the damned church saw was sex. Click to expand... perhaps, but apparently you returned the favor. o again, you ought to feel bad for your church. It's a \"sex church. I have since found other churches that aren't obsessed with sex and they were quite lovely. Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, church of Christ, MCC, so on. I don't need the sex churches, their don't serve God they worship sex, not interested, sorry. Click to expand... I'm a Methodist. We also affirm that homosexual practice is incompatible with Christian teaching. That doesn't make us a sex church any more than it does the Catholics."}
