With the presence of ICE in our communities, I am fearful for my neighbors and friends. However, I am finding it challenging to effectively communicate to neighbors haven't yet met that my household and I offer a safe environment and are prepared to offer support and protection. As someone who is not particularly outgoing, I am uncomfortable with the idea of simply approaching and knocking on doors, and I wish to avoid causing any further unease in a community already experiencing fear.\n\nTherefore, my question is, would it be suitable to compose a letter to inform my neighbors that we are a safe haven?",

So while you’re signing this one, be sure to take a minute and search for the one on ICE. Let’s really get some signatures.\n\nAlso, on each petition, there’s a comment section where you can either write out a comment, or, leave a voice or video comment. For those of you who are especially creative, I’m sure you’ll make those comments count.\n\nThere’s also one to Impeach Trump and to release the Epstein Investigation files as well as have key Witnesses subpoenaed.\n\nI realize it is not a protest, all of the protesters, you are the bravest people I know and I thank you all for what you’re doing. As always you are all my neighbors and I love you so be safe.",

You can't \"steal\" a job or there would be lots of dead CEO as people kill them for their positions over and over for that high 6 figure pay. No the issue is the one's employing them as they willingly hire these people knowing they're desperate for any money for their families and are willing to work for pennies but seeing as how MAGA view the rich as a protective class they don't bother going after the ones that are actually at fault, that and a immigrant is a easier target for them then a rich asshole. \n\nThen there's the \"tHeY'rE tAkInG oUr MoNeY aNd GeTtiLInG fReE hEaLtHcArE aNd GeTtInG pAiD wElFaRe MoNey!\"... no just no, you need to sign a LOT of paperwork and have a valid state ID you know the ones that require a legal birth certificate to prove you're a legal American citizen or you won't be assigned a case worker.\n\n The closest thing I can think on why the idiots think a illegal immigrant get free medical is because a hospital isn't allowed to refuse emergency medical services even if they're in the country illegally and no you do NOT want to get rid of this because if they do they will go back to refusing to provide emergency services if say you couldn't pay. It used to be a problem with some hospitals before that was changed.\n\n Then again seeing as how these idiots voted for the pedo in chief whose literally making many MAGA lives hell I can see them praising Trump if he gets rid of that to \"denie the illegal help\", they'll keep praising until they need a doctor visit and get refused because they couldn't afford it anymore and if you voted for Trump you're just getting what you voted for and thus deserve.",

My family is the same way. My sister used to join me on continuously reposting instagram reels showing the destruction that is happening and now her and everyone I know are posting less and less. I have called out some friends who have been vocal to me and out protesting but they post NOTHING on social media. \n\nDo they not care anymore?

I'm a 19 year old girl living with my fiance in Florida. Ice is in my town. I've been very public online how I dislike our president and how I feel about this administration. And at one point I posted on the town Facebook the names of people in our town that were ice agents.It has come to my attention that in the nicest way possible I'm being tracked. People in my neighborhood have heard agents asking for me by name. I'm terrified. I was born here, so was my mom, so was my grandma, and her mother before that. There can not be any judge that would sign anything to get me deported since my family hasn't known anything but the us for a very long time. I need help getting out of here. Does anyone know how I can get me, my fiance and our two cats out of America before we are killed?",

      "author": "SpiritRude",

      "text": "I think we need to make a real effort to rename \"rubber bullets\". \"Rubber bullet\" is a term that is used to make the public perceive these rounds as much less harmful than they actually are. They often cause terrible injuries and kill more often than many people would think. People often break bones, including their skulls, have their eyes destroyed, lose fingers, and get large cuts and other traumatic injuries.\n\nCops and ICE agents are so emboldened and, based on what I've seen/heard, they're shooting people at very close range with these rounds more often.\n\n**Blunt-Force Trauma Round** is much more accurate. The injuries these rounds cause are blunt force trauma injuries. As we all know, blunt-force trauma injuries can cause permanent damage, disability, and death. The accuracy of the language we use is very important, especially when it comes to matters of life and death.\n\nI'd be curious to get other suggestions if anyone has one.",

      "title": "Do we need to shift from single day to long-term protesting?",
      "author": "sam-erickson-89",
      "subreddit": "fuckICE",
      "text": "I'm not a scholar or political scientist or anything, so please forgive my rambling and lack of education on the subject. I've tried reading up on this but I haven't been able to find much. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, or just using the wrong combinations of words.\n\nSomething that's been running through my mind the past few weeks is the question of whether a protesting or marching for a single day can really force any meaningful change. We can do a one day economic blackout, but between stocking up in the days leading up and going back to shopping like usual the day after, we're not really affecting anyone's bottom line. If feels like a symbolic gesture, but I'm not sure what the real impact is beyond showing our dissatisfaction.\n\nSimilar question with walk-outs. We can ditch work, school, and whatever other daily activities for a day, but we go right back the next day and nothing significant has changed. I understand it's important to show our elected representatives we're upset and we have numbers, but it feels like we could do more than that.\n\nWe just keep replacing neoliberals with other neoliberals, who pander to us with their words but go right back to supporting whatever legislation benefits the finance industry, military-industrial complex, or whoever else is funding their reelection campaign. They tell us they hear us, but then turn around and capitulate to Republicans because they don't want to upset the status quo. They give us mealy-mouthed statements about how ICE just needs better training. Besides that, there are so many unelected people who have just as much or more influence over things.\n\nSo I guess my question is, what if we walked out for more than a day? What if we spent weeks stockpiling non-perishable food, essentials, saving every penny we can to pay future bills, some extra for our neighbors if we can afford it and they can't, and then just... walked out indefinitely?\n\nI understand almost all work is essential in the sense that it's needed for that person's livelihood and for the economy as a whole to continue functioning. But if everyone whose job isn't absolutely necessary to people's survival, safety, wellbeing, etc, just said \"I'm leaving and I'm not coming back until this is fixed,\" I feel like it would force the hands of the people who hold the levers of power. I'm talking about a protracted, long-term strike that refuses to end just because things get uncomfortable.\n\nI'm sure it would be unpleasant for a lot of us, but that might be a sacrifice we have to come to terms with. You have to live off canned food for weeks? People are getting kidnapped by masked federal agents. Your kids are missing school? People are being sent to foreign prisons without a trial. You might lose your job? People have been shot in the street.\n\nAgain, sorry for rambling, I'm just feeling a little frustrated with the lack of change I'm seeing. Feels like it's time to take more drastic measures.",

      "text": "I want to start a petition to cancel independence day at least in my little corner of the world.\nI don't care you're political side if you are sickened by ICE killing innocent people using innocent children to bait their innocent parents who only want a better life for the ones they love. Which I will remind everyone that this is what american is supposed to be. \nWe are a country of immagrants. \nUnless you are a native American you family most likely has an imagrant in the tree. Or even worse you could go back to the colonizers from England.  \n\nThe January 30 strike was a good idea but it was to short notice and not greatly organized. \n\nWe have 6 months and social media and the internet to cancel independence day.\n\nAnd I have plans.\n\nIt starts with canceling parades and firework displayd one city, county and state at a time.\nNo buying any decorations.\nNo buying any food for the first 4 days of July. \nNo buying anything unless it's emergency for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th of july. No gas. no cloths. no food. drinks.alcohol. weed. NOTHING!\nDon't decorate for Independence day. \nNo stars and stripes.\nNo red, white and blue.\nNo personal fireworks even if you have some left over from a previous year.\nIt's just about not spending money it's about sending a message. \nThe sky must be dark, the air must be silent. No rockets red glare.\nNo organized sporting events for the first 4 days of July the the national anthem should remain unsung.\n\nIf possible no work for the 1st 2nd 3rd if your job already gives you off on those days don't work the day you were supposed to be back.\n\nIf we can't get the parade and fireworks canceled in your state, city or county have a protest, sit in or some type of peaceful disruption of the parade and firework display.\n\nUse social media. \nLike use that shit against them.\n\nGot 100 followers on your tik tok spread the word. \nHave a favorite Podcaster or other content creator who focus on political protests or really anyone against what is going on in this country right now send them this. Send them the petitions to cancel both the fireworks display and parade in their area.\n\nCall your local politicians.\n\nFind the local businesses that do not support ICE or even better do not support the hatred and violence or MAGA and support those businesses. (I know this one is especially hard I am disabled and on a fixed income so I really don't have enough to be picky about where I buy my needs but I am going to try. )\n\nTalk to your friends.\nTalk to strangers if you feel it's safe.\nWear you thoughts, make t-shirts or hats even with \nDEFUND I.C.E.! \nRELEASE THE TRUMP-STEIN FILES! \nDUMP TRUMP!\nmost importantly be safe. We see the violence these monsters are doing with near impunity let's be vigilant and careful about how we dismantle with rotting travesty. \n\n",

So I found a perfect way to get revenge on them. Buy a lidar scanner,  point it at their phone and the lasers that are built into it, will burn the phones camera, making it useless. These scanners are easy to get and can't damage the human eye so it's not an attack. Technically you are just filming. ",

      "text": "Hi all - does anyone know of a Go Fund Me or an alternative donation we can give to / share for Castañeda Mondragón, the man whose skull was shattered by ICE a few weeks ago?\n\nAccording to an AP News article I just read: \n\n“To the surprise of some who treated him, Castañeda Mondragón was discharged from the hospital Tuesday. A hospital spokeswoman said she had no information about him.\n\nThe Justice Department filed court documents this week affirming Castañeda Mondragón is no longer in custody. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment on the man’s injuries.\n\nCastañeda Mondragón has no family in Minnesota and coworkers have taken him in, the man’s brother said. He has significant memory loss and a long recovery ahead. He won’t be able to work for the foreseeable future, and his friends and family worry about paying for his care.\n\n“He still doesn’t remember things that happened. I think (he remembers) 20% of the 100% he had,” said Gregorio Castañeda Mondragón, who lives in Mexico. “It’s sad that instead of having good memories of the United States, you’re left with a bad taste in your mouth about that country because they’re treating them like animals.”\n\nI feel like we should help support this poor man and his friends who are caring for him - he has a 10 year old daughter. \n\nThis is my first Reddit Post and I have no experience making a Go Fund Me, so any help or suggestions anyone has would be much appreciated - thanks so much.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-minneapolis-hospitals-32cd5ca61d495e155d43b7cfd5e563b9#",

But that's in the middle of nowhere, and the people shot are foreigners, likely coyotes, so nobody gives a damn.\n\nThat said, CBP also operates in airports. They're the guys with the dogs that sniff for apples in people's luggages, or the people that stamp your passport.

There is nothing noble about your mission. There is no reason to terrorize your neighbors. You will never defeat the woll of the People. Do you not remember our Constitution?\n\nDo you miss your families and your friends? They are questioning your choices. You only bring harm. Your presence is only violence. Your only accomplishment is causing chaos. There are protests against you. People do not like you for the decisions you have made. \n\nWhy do you choose violence? When you sit alone at night and think of your loved ones, history has its eyes on you. You cannot escape.\n\nSoon your fascist leadership will turn on you. Their Anti-American ideas will never defeat the woll of The People. You are weak. You have no cause. You are not welcome into our communities. Why do you stay? Tell your officers you want to go home. Tell them you will not fight anymore. Tell them how the will  of the American people will never be defeated. \n\nQuit the job, Ice Agents.

When agencies are allowed to operate with minimal oversight and legal immunity, abuse becomes easier—and trust between the public and law enforcement erodes.\n\nHistory shows that when people feel unheard and unprotected, tensions rise. That’s not good for communities or public safety. The solution is not violence—it’s accountability, transparency, and lawful reform.\n\nPeaceful protest and public pressure are how real change has always happened in this country. The First Amendment exists for this exact reason. If you’re disturbed by what you’re seeing:\n\n•\tJoin peaceful protests\n\n•\tShare verified photos and videos\n\n•\tCall and write your local, state, and federal representatives\n\n•\tSupport organizations working on civil rights and legal oversight\n\nOne concrete reform that deserves serious attention is ending or significantly reforming qualified immunity, so no government agent is above the law.\n\nSilence only enables abuse. Peaceful, collective action is how we protect our rights and each other",

      "author": "Independent_Storm336",
      "subreddit": "fuckICE",
      "text": "I watched all the videos and different angles of this latest unnecessary tragic murder by these wannabe GI Joe nazi ICE terrorists, and like many of you, I still have some questions!\n\n1. Why is nobody talking about how the guy who took the gun from Pretti just ran away from the scene? He looked pretty shady running away and then goes off camera. Where did he go? Is this standard procedure when taking a gun off a suspect being detained? And yes I know that none of things ICE is doing are normal or considered standard procedure.\n\n2. Could the guy in the grey who took the gun have fired the first shot as a signal for the other goons to shoot and kill Pretti? Nobody in the media or gov seems to be talking about if any bullets were even fired from Pretti’s gun. It doesn’t look like guy in grey fires the gun when he takes it, but It is kinda blurry and happens so fast. \n\n3. Could this have been part of a larger plan to find a protester that has a gun and use it as justification for shooting him? Maybe it backfired since he never pulled it out, so they just grabbed it and fired the first shot so they could fire “defensive shots.” \n\nI think we need Pretti’s cell phone footage, if it still exists. I’m also curious if he told them he had a gun when they were all on the ground. Its tough to see, even slowing it down to 0.25 speed, but to me it looks like he had the gun tucked in his back waist, then had his shirt tucked into his pants covering the gun, and his jacket covering it more. \n\nIt appears that when he sort of gets up onto his knees, one of the agents in front of him pulls his jacket up, revealing the gun. This is when guy in grey takes it and we hear the first shot almost immediately after that. I feel like this proves that he never even attempted to use his gun, since it’s clearly tucked behind him, under the shirt and jacket. \n\n4. Does DHS not issue handcuffs?? If these armed thugs are supposedly trained LEOs, they should know how to detain and cuff a suspect. They had SEVEN guys on Pretti, who looks like he could weigh 160 pounds. How in the actual fuck do they not just handcuff him or even use those standard issue law enforcement zip ties that ALREADY COME TIED AND LOOPED.\n\nIt’s absolutely mind boggling how 7-10 guys could not detain one skinny guy, so they fucking shoot him 10 times and kill him. I can not believe the country we live in right now!!",

The federal government is taking ppl away and hurting/murdering the ppl that are standing up to them and its stirring up something inside of us... The indigenous ppl of this land still feel the trauma that was inflicted on our ancestors.  We are standing up to protect one another because we know this feeling, we know what's happening. Thats why so many indigenous people are fighting back against the takeover of Minnesota. The deep ache of pain and sadness that unites us as indigenous people, is what's pushing us to act now. In the hopes of preventing history from repeating itself. The invasion of ICE has awakened our ancestors... They refuse to back down, they refuse to remain silent. Through us they will make themselves known and they'll give us the strength to fight for what is right. To all my indigenous brothers and sisters, its time... Ik you feel it too. It feels like the rythmic beating of ancient drums that vibrates deep into our soul. It sounds like the echos of warrior cries against stone walls and across great lakes... Warriors, its time for battle. Resist.\n\nICE OUT! ",

They want to be able to say “See? They killed one of ours! Now we ARE the victims! Now we SHOULD invoke the insurrection act!” They want you to be so overwhelmed with anger and hate that you take the law into your own hands. Don’t fall for it. Be there for your friends, your neighbours, your community. Film them from every angle; give their lies no purchase.\n\nThey are escalating because the current fear campaign is failing. This will get worse before it gets better, but if you stick to the plan, it will get better in the end. More and more people are opening their eyes to the lies of the regime. Hell, Fox News is calling BS on the Alex Pretti narrative that the regime is spinning. Without the support of the governed, they will lose. Stay the course, support your fellow citizens. Fuck ICE.

      "text": "hello,\n\nMy dad (59 M) is finally willing to hear about the atrocities carried out by ICE and the human rights violations, deaths and illegality of many of the Trump’s administration’s actions. \n\n  \nHe has listened to Fox News every day nearly all day (including the night time while he sleeps) for many years. He has every right wing talking point tucked away in the back of his head and he is incredibly hard to convince of anything. He doesn’t believe anything from social media (unless it fits his narrative) and thinks Trump is a strong, common sense leader who just happens to have a strange sense of humor. He also sees ICE agents as men who are doing their best to rid the country of criminals. when I talked to him the other day he said he hasn’t seen anything about ICE detaining citizens, refugees or treating detainees like animals in inhumane conditions. \n\n  \nI’m asking for y‘all to help me out and send articles, videos, anything that you think might convince him not only that what’s happening is real but that it’s illegal and inhumane. Cases that are irrefutable. \n\nwe had a massive fight a few days ago and this morning he said that he will hear me out and that he’s going to try and be a better person and to attempt to be less politicized. I’m not holding my breath but I think I have a short window to get him thinking. \n\n  \nthank you in advance!\n\nTL;DR: my Fox News obsessed father asked me to send him information about trump and ice from another point of view. please send articles/videos that would be nearly impossible to refute with right wing talking points.\n\n",

      "author": "Prosepuzzle",
      "subreddit": "fuckICE",
      "text": "There's a policy analysis getting discussion in r/PublicPolicy right now that directly addresses ICE enforcement—and it's worth reading if you want to understand what's actually happening with immigration enforcement.\n\nThe core argument: current ICE enforcement fails by its own stated metrics (fiscal impact, labor market effects, public safety). It doesn't reduce undocumented populations, it's expensive, and it destabilizes critical infrastructure. Yet it persists.\n\nWhy? Because different coalition members are actually solving for different problems:\n\n* Some focus on labor/fiscal concerns (economic framing)\n* Others explicitly want demographic control (they admit this)\n* The system accepts infrastructure vulnerability as acceptable\n\n**The real insight:** An honest analysis has to acknowledge these different motivations exist—and that explains both why enforcement persists despite worse measurable outcomes AND what would actually need to shift for change.\n\nIf you're here because enforcement isn't working as promised, or you want to understand the actual policy dynamics underneath the debate, this breaks it down.\n\n**Check out the full discussion:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1qn1f8r/policy\\_analysis\\_integrationfocused\\_immigration/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1qn1f8r/policy_analysis_integrationfocused_immigration/)",

Please point me to another Reddit group if you think there is a group better suited to answer this question.\n\nI am intentionally being vague here, to be safe. \n\nI live in Memphis, TN, and I currently have a Dream Scholar doing an internship where I work, who has a court case sometime this semester in Raleigh, NC that will solidify his legal citizenship status.\n\nI am worried about ICE targeting him either on the way to the case or at the actual courthouse (as they have been known to do). Does anyone have any advice on how to best protect him? \n\nI (white male) am considering driving him there myself, having him in the backseat, following all speed/safety laws, and going with him to the courthouse. But if a situation arises, I am just one guy against god knows how many ICE agents and won’t be able to protect him if I am outnumbered. Are there agencies I can contact or other protections I can put in place to help him have the best chance at making his court case unscathed? Any advice is welcome!\n\nThank you ",

However, I wanted to reach out and express my concern upon something I saw today while at school. \n\nWas sitting in my car and went to go connect to my hotspot and saw this while doing so. I don't want to jump to conclusions and just say “oh well it must be ice”. Ice has been spotted in the area where I go to school and several areas around it, I just do not know.\n\nTried to look up if ICE vans go by numbers, letters, names. Obviously could not find anything because they want to protect their privacy as much as possible. \n\nYeah, fuck that.\n\nIt could be someone who is trying to be a little joker and racist just playing a prank. I just wanted to get other people's input.\n\nNo, I am not telling you where I live/what area I live in due to my safety and privacy. \n\nHelp me expose these nazis, kidnappers, rapists, and racists. Please tell me what you guys think, thanks!",

Does this sound like a good idea or is it too risky or dangerous in any way? If not, anyone happen to know any abandoned buildings that are 100% not inhabited in any way or places frequented exclusively by like karens or white people in general? (even better if it's like some kind of maga meeting point or smth)\n\nI'd love to make those fuckers waste their time for nothing :)\n\nAlso if you happen to know other subreddits to crosspost this it could be helpful",

Also it would be like a way to poetical fight them. \n\nBut I do not know progamming nor drawing 😭 I tried to change the sprites from wolfenstein 3d with a software but don't know anything to do",

An ICE agent called yesterday because one of our hotel refused service and asked them to leave because they are part of that organization. He called to cancel all of his future reservation with us and also with his account (club member lol not even an elite member). I happily cancelled all of his non-refundable reservations as he requested. He mentioned he will dispute those charges to his bank (as if that will help him). I have his details should if should I post it here 🤭",

The preparations to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty soldiers into a major American city represent a historic escalation of the drive toward dictatorship. They must be answered through the mass, independent action of the working class and the development of a genuine general strike movement, in Minneapolis and throughout the country.\n\nThis means the immediate formation of rank-and-file committees in every workplace, school and neighborhood. Emergency meetings should be called at every site—union and non-union—to elect representatives and begin planning a unified response. These committees must demand and prepare for open-ended strike action, organized across sectors and regions. Their demands should include: the withdrawal of all federal forces; the arrest and prosecution of Renee Nicole Good’s killer; the abolition of ICE, CBP and DHS and the release of all detainees.",

Both committing atrocities and violating US citizens' first and fourth amendment rights. Both shooting and killing people. Tear gassing innocent people who didn't do anything. I know someone who wants to join border patrol and to me, even being willing to help out the gestapo is an unforgivable offense and I don't want someone like that in my life at anyway. I find it beyond revolting that someone with a lot of options would choose to go work for Kristi Noem. I am certain this person would say they are just looking to provide for their family, but I bet you that the security forces who murdered 16,000 Iranian protestors would say the same thing. I am also no longer accepting ignorance as an excuse for working for these pieces of shit. \n\nWhat would you say to cut ties with someone who wants to join border patrol and help crush freedom in america?

I was too seething with anger/fixated on this yuppie who took pictures of my sign (which had Renee Nicole Good’s final words “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you” written on it) and laughed at it to even notice the ice swallowing incident. Now that I’ve put the clips together, I just realized that he CAME BACK and CONTINUED to mock us!! To add insult to injury, THIS is what he had to say about the incident, too. These are the people making decisions for us. Wow. ",

We aim to create a demonstration of resistance against ICE in all state capitols and major cities across the United States.\n\nThis is still in the early stages of planning, so here's what we need in order to be successful:\n\n* A graphic and/or video\n   * We would like to have a staple graphic image and/or video to project in each city (projected on buildings, perhaps?).\n   * The graphic should be intimidating by sharing a firm stance of resistance. Something like \"ICE out,\" \"ICE will hang,\" or \"ICE melts when there's heat.\" The slogans could vary, but we want to create a consistent campaign that makes it clear that this was one organized initiative.\n   * We could also project a video in each city. Something that highlights the horrors that ICE has inflicted on people across the country. We want to draw into people's emotional response.\n   * If you are a graphic designer or video editor, please share your designs/videos with us so we can vote on which ones to use.\n* Representatives from all major cities and capitals\n* Social media coverage from each city (Up to your discretion whether you choose to stay anonymous or not)\n* Hope that this coverage picks up enough attention for national news\n\nOnce we decide on a graphic/video we can choose a date for the protest.\n\n**If interested: (r/ICE\\_Melts)**",

Notice whenever I asked for clarification of what type of disrespect actually happened, their default response is \"well you just weren't too nice\"\n\nThey'd rather defend Gestapo than allow for debate. To clarify, I myself am a Christian. But what has me outraged is the fact it is Christians like Jonathan Ross himself who are responsible for this. And why? Because Christians in America have themselves a culture of authoritarian principles which instantly quells anything they may perceive as opposition. It's exactly why so many Christians defend ICE, and it sickens me. \n\nThe thread for reference (where a grand total of one my posts may still be up): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1q7fpv3/what\\_can\\_regular\\_citizens\\_do\\_about\\_the\\_horrific/nzh9b8t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1q7fpv3/what_can_regular_citizens_do_about_the_horrific/nzh9b8t/)",

Most of the time I honestly don’t think they even read it. I think they see a report and go look, realize they agree with the opinion of the person that reported you/disagree with your position broadly, and just ban you because they can and you have no recourse. I think it just takes a certain type of person to see being able to “run” a community as sufficient payoff for the work they have to do. \n\nMost people wouldn’t want to deal with it, those who do seem to be… special, and this tendency seems nearly ubiquitous, it doesn’t matter the sub. Obviously some are worse than others though. \n\n• You argued with a Reddit mod in r/Christian\n \nChristians insist that a book they literally can’t read is the actual word of the creator of the universe, and pretend that whichever translation they picked wasn’t just translated by some guy that some church leaders paid, but that it is the actual word of God, exactly as they were handed down to us as an oral tradition 2000+ years ago. They believe they’re absolved of all wrong doing because this same creator, rather than just forgiving us, made a “son” that he had to make a *virgin* give birth to, who happened to be married but that is beside the point, but it’s actually not his son because it’s him, and then he sacrificed his sonself to himself so that he could forgive us. Mind you, he is also all powerful and created the fucking universe. I know that’s confusing, and that’s because it’s confusing, because it doesn’t make an fucking sense, because it was written by drunk people with lead poisoning 1000 years after they came up with it and then bastardized to appease various warlords, feudal monarchs and church leaders for about a millennia. \n\nThey believe that when they’re running around spraying their spit on everyone pretending to speak the language of God, they’re actually communing with heavens instead of stringing together random syllables that all happen to be derived from their first language. \n\nI could go on and on. \n\nBut yeah, you should never be surprised again if something like this happens.",

They should do it NOW and start establishing truthful alibies to prove their non-involvement later if they care AT ALL about ANY kind of future for themselves or their family as their names will be MUDD soon and there will be no going back.

To sort of protect them or at least serve as a witness? Do these exist? Would it have to be a non profit? Would they need legal expertise? Just curious. I don't know what we can do anymore so my mind is just running with ideas.(cross posted)",

        "body": "In recent years, the global Internet, in particular on the Reddit platform, has been experiencing activities that can be described as the actions of a criminal international underground organization known as the Secret police. This organization uses sophisticated methods of monitoring and analyzing user content to identify individuals who express criticism of authoritarian regimes, corruption and nepotism.\n\nAfter identifying the identity and location of these individuals, the \"secret police\" applies a set of repressive measures aimed at the psychological and moral suppression of their victims. These measures include systematic psychological pressure, moral violence, as well as a wide range of provocative actions such as slander, harassment, intimidation, surveillance, framing, the use of information traps and provocations. The organization actively uses social networks and other digital platforms as a tool to achieve its goals.\n\nRepresentatives of all social strata and age groups can become victims of this activity, but lonely and isolated individuals, whose personal boundaries and psychological stability are most susceptible to destructive effects, show particular vulnerability.\n\nThe purpose of such actions is to inflict maximum psychological and moral damage to the victims, which can lead to the development of mental disorders, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Thus, the \"secret police\" seeks not only to suppress dissent, but also to demoralize and destabilize society as a whole.\n\nThis phenomenon poses a serious threat to human rights and requires a comprehensive approach to its study and counteraction by the international community, including law enforcement agencies and academic institutions.",

      "author": "ElderMillennialNurse",

      "text": "Today is November 3rd, one day before Election Day. Not sure if that’s relevant or not. \n\nToday in Yonkers, NY, there is a noted federal raid of some sort. Many think it’s an ICE raid but others are saying it’s “DEA” due to a patch that one person is wearing. To me the patch seems fake. For what I have seen, typically the letters DEA are larger to make it easier to identify that the agent is in fact DEA. I’ll add the link to the Facebook post as well as the specific picture.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BNtcKPZAs/?mibextid=wwXIfr\n\nThe person wearing the DEA patch, looks like he s**t his pants. It seems sloppy for a federal agent. Nothing seems legit. Every person is wearing different patches. Something just seems right. I personally think since ICE are basically criminals anyway, they have no concern of impersonating police, I wouldn’t put it past them that they would get a fake DEA patch. Especially to get people to think they’re not ICE so no one will interfere.\n\nHas anyone heard or seen anything like this? If this is the case, this information needs to be known\n\nOpinions? Anything at all?",

I keep thinking, 'Man, what the fuck?' I recently heard that a compatriot of mine was arrested in the federal building while applying for her green card (note: she was purposely separated from her American husband and lawyer and then detained). I also read that many immigrants are being taken to unknown places and there are no records of it. I'm numb—how come no one is doing anything? I read reports that agents don't care if you prove you're a citizen; they arrest you anyway. So, I ask, what the fuck is wrong and going on in America ?",

We went to see him the day of his actual deportation and the bus left early and I never got to say goodbye. \n\nWe have talked on the phone for the last 20 years and grown our relationship. He knows my soul and I know his and there is so much love there. There is also so much pain. I’ve never been financially stable enough to be able to plan a trip to Jalisco but I hope I can one day. My fear is never seeing him if he gets sick and dies or just get older. \n\nI have ptsd and seeing everything going on, the parents and families being torn apart and the blatant presence of ICE causing fear in every community in this country feels so bad sometimes I feel like I can’t breath. I don’t want children to feel the same pain and cry the same tears I have for 20 years. With that said CHINGA LA MIGRA. ",

      "text": "Woke up to banging on the door at 7am. Normal looking guy with a clipboard (covering the logo on his hoodie) was there so I opened the door with the chain on. He said he was “PD” and needed to talk to my building supervisor, and that he was listed as my apartment (crazy enough he also happened to be listed as my neighbors apartment when they knocked. Weird coincidence). Then two guys in vests with guns and tasers and stuff came up from behind him. They tried to push in the door, saying it wasn’t my apartment and there here for the “guy who lives here”. \n\nI called 911 right after I yelled as loud as I could “no one open your door it’s ice” and slammed the door. They identified as cops, and tried to force entry under false pretenses; seems pretty crimey to me idk. The cops called the local DHS office to get a name or at least confirmation an agent was there. The guy on the phone (on speaker so I heard) said “I have so many agents I can’t be expected to know where they are. I also can’t give out any information for their safety” before hanging up on the NYPD. They called back, the guy said to file a complaint with the DOJ (I’m sure that would work…). The cops clearly felt bad at least but like there’s not much they can do I get it. That was scary ",

I'll never ever understand it. The irony of having a career in law enforcement, but supporting these lawless kidnappings. She got all fired up when she said her relatives who are ICE are constantly treated with disrespect by fellow Mexicans. (Like, of course - how did you think they'd react?)\n\nHer point of view is that she dealt with gang violence in Mexico and immigrants bring crime here to the US. \n\nI get that we could use better screening processes. I get that gangs exist. But turning ICE into the gestapo isn't the answer. Anyway. Just blows my mind. ",
