      "text": "My husband was just granted voluntary departure by the immigration judge. He is currently in ICE detention.\n\nHe has a Russian passport but was born in Tajikistan. He cannot safely return to either country.\n\nHas anyone been granted voluntary departure and successfully chosen to go to a third country instead of their home country? For example, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, or another country?\n\nIf so:\n\n* What country did you go to?\n* How did you arrange it?\n* Did you have to contact that country's consulate yourself?\n* Did ICE allow it without issues?\n\nWe are trying to figure out if this is even possible before the deadline runs out.\n\nAny advice or experience is appreciated.",

      "author": "Entrepreneurmommy",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "I am a Venezuelan national currently living in Orlando. I entered the U.S. in 2015 on a B1/B2 visa and filed for Affirmative Asylum shortly after. I finally had my USCIS interview in June 2025, but I’ve been waiting 8+ months for a decision.\n\nMy current status situation is a bit of a \"alphabet soup\":\n\n• Asylum: Pending decision (post-interview).\n\n• TPS: I had it, but I’m confused about the current status due to the recent terminations/stays.\n\n• H1-B: Recently approved, but I cannot leave to get the stamp due to the current travel ban/suspension for Venezuelans.\n\n• EB3: I have a pending process, but the visa bulletin is backlogged by about a year.\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nMy employer wants me to travel to Atlanta for a week. I am extremely nervous because of the reported raids in Florida and the heavy ICE presence in the Southeast lately.\n\nMy questions for the community:\n\n1. Since my H1-B is approved but I am technically \"change of status\" within the U.S., am I at risk if I encounter ICE at an airport or during a domestic stop?\n\n2. I have a valid EAD (Work Permit) and my I-797 receipt for the asylum case. Is this enough \"Proof of Lawful Presence\" for a domestic flight or if I am stopped by police in Georgia?\n\n3. Given the current climate in Feb 2026, is the risk of \"roving patrols\" between Florida and Georgia high enough that I should refuse the trip?\n\nI am terrified of being detained when I have followed every legal rule for 10 years. Any advice or recent experiences with ATL airport would be appreciated.",

I was wondering what i can do with my military benefits and service to ensure they all are at least safe while i’m in Florida. I need the best opinions and advice from anyone who has an idea of what steps i can take! \n\nMy mom also said if they are to be detained and deported she’ll ask my aunt (got her citizenship through family) to take care of my sisters to eventually send them to mexico so they’re not separated, yes my sisters also have dual citizenship and passports.",

If granted, PiP should be sufficient to protect them from ICE.\n\nThe risk here is applying for PiP and having it denied. Then essentially they're giving ICE their address + related info and letting ICE know that they're here illegally. A consult with an immigration lawyer with all their detailed immigration history will give them a better sense of the risk and ensure that the form is properly filed. \n\nIn theory, just a consult with JAG should be fine because they're not supposed to be sharing confidential client information with DHS/ICE. Though it's unknown if that has changed under this administration where they're trying to encourage more information exchange even if the legal precedence is iffy. \n\nSo consulting with a civilian lawyer is probably safer in regards to maintaining their privacy when evaluating their next steps.",

(And even to get to that number, you have to pretend everyone (including the children, elderly, disabled, etc.) works a w2 job with withholding, and file taxes as single adults.\n\nThe math gets complicated with state taxes, but you end up needing every single illegal immigrant to make $50k-$70k a year to get that number.",

I know that alot of ppl live in poverty in the world and as sad as that is, the answer cant be that they all come here. There are lots of kids living in poverty in America where the only \"privilege\" they have is being born in here. Those kids deserve to have what opportunity they have to be protected too. If we imported every refugee in the world it would no longer be a sanctuary for them and anyone coming in the future. Im sorry for your situation and I hope the best, but dont blame and demonize americans or the us bc they cant absorb every immigrant in the world that would fall under the category of needing or wanting to come. Ppl like to make it about race or cruelty but it would be no more fair if the situation was reversed and Americas were flooding South America and taking up resources from citizens of their countries. Its just reality and when it comes to immigration there is no possible way to be fair to everyone.",

The parole is important because this will later allow them to potentially Adjust Status (Adjustment of Status is the process of a person without any legal status adjusting and/or legally transitioning to a person with legal status inside the United States). The Adjustment of Status can happen once you or any other of your U.S. Citizen siblings turns 21 YO. \n\nEven though legal residency can’t happen for a few years for your folks get them the Parole. It will help them tremendously. You don’t need to be 21 in order to file the Parole in Place for them. \n\nAgain consult with an experienced Immigration Lawyer. You want it done right. Especially given the times we’re in. \n\nI saw someone suggesting you file an I-130 first. No. Don’t do that. It will get denied because you are not 21 YO yet. Consult with a good Immigration Attorney. \n\nBest of luck to you. Rooting for you and your parents.",

If you are married this gets somewhat easier.  \n\nIf you have someone in your chain of command to talk to about taking emergency leave if it becomes necessary that you trust it would be best to have that discussion sooner rather than later.\n\nMost of my experience was from the perspective of wartime deployed Army and managing out single parents that couldn’t deploy, much of which was dictated by the staffing needs at the time so your experience may differ.  Good luck, Marine.\n\nEDIT: after rereading your post I glossed over the part where your aunt would take care of them.  Theres nothing really for you to do in this case unless its to briefly help them transition in the case that your parents are detained.  \n\nIf your sisters already have dual citizenship have your parents considered self-deporting to save the trouble of a traumatic arrest/deportation?",

Im up in Minnesota, and let me tell you its not a great time for families having to shelter in place right now.  We’ve been having to provide and deliver groceries and support for almost a month now, and the ICE agents feel like they’re everywhere.\n\nMaybe the winds shift sometime in the next couple of years to a more favorable environment for people to do their paperwork and get legalized but right now is not the time to be rolling the dice when kids’ lives are on the line.\n\nYou’ll be in my thoughts and good luck with this, its a sticky wicket.",

Because you ain’t leaving this country if you go AWOL.\n2. You are an adult now, just like your parents are adults. Kids never under any circumstances owe their parents a thing. Parents make adult choices to benefit their kids and themselves. Are your parents children? Did you force them to make any choices?\n3. You have options but nah with your mom’s attitude… screw that there is absolutely no way in hell any normal parent would risk their child’s career because she doesn’t want to act like an adult who made adult decisions on her own.",

But to be clear I firmly believe your parents should have had a plan from when you were born in case they were deported, it seems like completely irresponsible parenting. What is their plan in a “what if” situation? When you were a baby what was their plan? Nevermind… not my problem.\n\nIf something happens to your parents and you have to take custody of your siblings. It’s a process but you can probably add them to your Tricare and get daycare and bigger housing for them. Idk if you are married but that is going to be a burden on your career. Not saying your siblings are a burden but your siblings aren’t your kids. 2 totally different things.",

      "author": "Pure_Drummer3350",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "I tend to rant, but here is the gist of it.\n\nI, (32) am the youngest of 7 and co own a home with my eldest brother whom is retired military, he lives out of state. \n\nWe are asian, I am natural born american and have been holding 2 jobs down since I was 18.\n\nMy meth addict brother, (48) now lives with us because he lost everything. Wife, kids, job.\n\nHe has zero hope.\n\nDiagnosed bi-polar with psychosis and also using, also has a manslaughter charge from the 90s and was in prison for 8 years I think.\n\nHe's on meds and has a final deportation order.\n\nHe accuses me of working for the police and conspiring to get him deported. Thinksnmy 2 wifi signals, 2.5 and 5.0 are government surveillance signals, and dismantles all of his phones because he eventually finds the internal Sim card or whatever inside them.\n\nA month ago, I left to the store to run some errands, when I come back my nephew, (13) runs up to me and whispers that uncle has a butcher knife.\n\nI confront my brother and he starts interrogating me about where I went.\n\nEventually I get the knife off of him peacefully.\n\nMy family still wont kick him out. I've kicked him out multiple times but since im the youngest, my eldest brother and Co owner of the house keeps bringing him back.\n\nMy eldest brother wants to hide him until Trump is out of office THEN find him real help. Which I I think is more containment of the problem than an actual plan.\n\nThis fucking asshole doesnt work, doesnt contribute and walks around the house menacing me and my mom, talking about \"where were you, who did you call etc.\"\n\nI've told him upfront he scares me, and when he's being manic I ask him if we're gonna be able to sleep at night.\n\nHe never threatens us, but he clearly knows what he's doing since he insinuates threats without ever directly stating it. Whenever I directly call out his menacing behavior; he plays word games like, \"did i SAY I was gonna hurt you guys? No i never said that. Why would you be afraid if you dont know something, hm? What do you know?\"\n\nThis guy is a fucking retard and I would rather just put a 9 in his empty skull.\n\nHe sings at the top of his lungs every single day, I can often hear him belting out songs from the 80s from my room downstairs. \n\nI think this piece of shit deserves the first boat back to southeast Asia. \n\nMy bills have more than doubled and I've already set a move out date cause im going to shoot this fucking asshole if I don't leave. My rich brother from out of state can handle the bills since he wants to play Jesus christ.\n\nMy brother doesnt expect him to get a job, doesnt even want the guy leaving cause hes so afraid ice will detain him. \n\nSo obviously this means I have to pay for the increased bills alone. Im not going to take care of a 50 year old gimp until im 40 because they dont wanna work. He is having an amazing life right now at the cost of my own life and it pisses me the fuck off.\n\nMy mother is in stroke territory and honestly I dont want to set her off. Thats the only reason I haven't turned him in.\n\nShe tells me she'll go back to public housing if I leave cause she is tired of cleaning up after my 2 adult siblings (whom have addiction issues).\n\nI keep thinking about turning this fuck face into ice. Even with the chance of being a social pariah, and being hated i dont really give a fuck cause this is just insane.\n\nAm I being heartless? Nobody is going to turn him in, and maybe im just being a pussy about it, but inhave honestly been a bit infantilized because my family is so dysfunctional.\n\nIm really worried that if I decide to turn him in, ice will show up and my mom will have a heart attack, she is average 168/xx or 180, sometimes 200 heart rate.\n\nWhat do you think? Imo, this living situation is not worth the trouble. And my mother and I should not have to take care of a psycho 50 year old addict just because he doesnt want to take care of his own affairs.\n\nWhat would you do? Is it heartless to turn him in? Tired of this parasite. He is a security risk, and i am genuinely afraid he is going to chop my mom up after i leave.\n\nIf you knew your mother's health was bad, would that also stop you from turning this guy in?",

Im not ashamed to admit to anyone that I am scared of making choices for myself, especially these types of choices. My opinion has always been downplayed and silenced.\n\nI am in a phase of my life where I have come to terms with being an adult, and im not afraid of them to the point where I stand my ground. This, however terrifies me and im afraid that following the law, or doing whats right (turning him in) is an emotionally charged and hasty decision on my part.\n\nI wrack my brain all the time, and I just keep thinking about tipping them off. The fallout scares me.",

I'd say like the biggest part of my job those first few years was dealing with persons ordered removed from countries that would not deal with our govt. / refused to take them back. We had mostly Cubans, Vietnamese, and Cambodians. They were subject to mandatory detention and we could hold them indefinitely if they were deemed a threat to public safety (We had to do periodic reviews of their case) and we kept getting the guys back in custody once they were released because they kept committing crimes. In 2001 or so, the Supreme Court said we could not hold them indefinitely and we pretty much stopped dealing with these people. If they didn't report on Order of supervision, there was nothing we could do. I bet your brother is one of these guys. ICE may actually pick him up now, but I bet it will be hard even for a third country to accept him with his mental problems.",

It's my oldest brother whom is guilting her to keep him.\n\nI've kicked him out multiple times after catching him using inside the house, it is my brother who brings him back.\n\n - obviously, nobody else is going to take him in. Which is how he ended up here in the first place.\n\nUltimately, im out of the house and off the bills, and will be filing the paperwork to get my name off the deed.\n\nMy mom is 75 and says she's going to go back to public housing, because there is no way she is going to take care of two 45 year olds- nor does she want to deal with their laziness and mood swings.\n\nSo my sister whom drank herself into end stage liver disease and my psychotic meth addict brother will most likely end up homeless within the next year or 2 anyway.\n\nSome might think im heartless, but you know what- at the end of the day I still housed them, supported them and cut pieces of myself off in order for them to have a stable and safe home to leech off of for 4 total years.\n\nMaybe I am, I dont think I am. Cause those of you who believe I am wouldnt take them in. The house is for my mom to have grass and peace.\n\nNot for 2 drug addicted junkies to live their best life.\n\nI appreciate the input, it might seem I am annoyed at those who call me heartless, I might be annoyed.\n\nBut I also paid $350-450/mo in electricity alone since they've moved in. I didnt bother them about any of it, and once I started asking for them to pull their weight, all of a sudden I dont pay for anything around the house.\n\nI work 10-12 hours a day just to come home to unlocked doors, an open garage door, lights left on, trash everywhere and petty screaming matches about who stole who's baked goods(true story).\n\nThen im slapped in the face with a $400 utility bill and $250 for water i barely get to use.\n\nSo yeah, im sore about it. I've sank maybe 30 grand into this house trying to build a peaceful place for my mom and in my opinion, its gone to waste because people want to play Jesus christ at my expense.\n\nBut im done carrying these people. I've already left and if God wills it, ill be back for my mom in a year or two, if I can bounce back from this.\n\nThanks again,",

We have property in Austria, live there and wanted to have our baby there. At 20 weeks pregnant we had to fly to America due to a surgery my husband had. We planned on flying back when I was at 28 weeks.\n\nHowever, I ended up going into pre term labor and was hospitalized for a week. I ended up not giving birth, but the doctors said I am not allowed to travel by airplane or car. \n\nMy ESTA is running out soon and I have tried contacting border control, ICE and a CBP deferred inspection office. I called, wrote emails and even went there in person. All of them said they can’t help and redirected me to the next office. Until eventually one person just told me extending my ESTA is impossible and that I will be deported and have to apply for a visa for future returns. \n\nMy baby isn’t here yet, no one knows when I will give birth or if my baby has to stay in the NICU and for how long. I just want to leave this country now, but I’m not allowed to and have no idea when I will be able to. \n\nI don’t want to get into trouble, because we do come back here a few times a year to see my partners family and some of his doctors. \n\nWill I face big consequences, like a ban from the country? Will they accept my application for a visa in the future? \n\nI am just super stressed right now. Any advice helps. Thank you.",

Be very specific when you call and ask for it and state that you can provide medical documentation to support it. I suggest calling a larger airport like JFK, LAX, or Miami who would be familiar with this process as it is very rarely used. It won’t give you the full time but it will allow you more breathing room to figure out what to do. Good luck!",

Considering she’s only 30 weeks pregnant and has no clue when the baby will come, it seems quite risky to not only overstay your ESTA, but also overstay your SD. \nAs for your actual comment: it doesn’t give her much breathing room (if the first SD is even approved).",

It sounds like she’s tried to request satisfactory departure and just didn’t have the right vocabulary terms and logistics, so there’s wiggle room here. Since the “application” is basically a phone call to the USCIS contact center. If needed, she can potentially position any “late” request for satisfactory departure as a request to reconsider her earlier “requests” that she made, just incorrectly.",

The biggest companies that own and run the detention centers are publicly traded, such as GEO Group and CoreCivic. Members of congress are allowed to both own stock and receive donations from these companies, and they also lobby hard. You make your own conclusions.",

Like they always have exceptions and emergencies that happen and again, my brother who  was also on an ESTA  did get it renewed twice.  She needs embassy and lawyer, expert help, not Reddit advisors. Who mean well.  Logic just seems to have gone out the window today in the more hostile environment and  something like this should never be held against her once she does the right thing and before it expires, she explains why she can’t travel. That’s basically all I was saying . But yes, of course I do agree with you that it has always been the case that you cannot just overstay a visa.\n\nMaybe she wants to go back to Austria and have her baby brought up there, be with her family etc, why should she have to be stuck in America and marry th and chang  her whole life because she had a medical emergency and spend all the money that it would entail, it’s very stressful and hard actually to  get green card through marriage. Why should she have to deal with this, especially in her precarious situation.  All I’m saying  is that everybody just telling her to get married to me is just nuts unless of course she wants to stay in America and get married.",

It’s worth a conversation with an immigration lawyer who works with addressing status violations and overstays at the consular level. It sounds  from the limited information here that your future goals are temporary visas, so you’re most likely looking at no more ESTA, needing to apply for a tourist visa, and needing to document and explain the purpose of the overstay, provided the overstay is fewer than 180 days. It gets more complicated once you’ve overstayed at least 180 days. \n\nThat said, this is still technically fixable. ESTA is the name of an online application used for admission under the “visa waiver” program. While not formally extendable, there is a process called “satisfactory departure” that allows for time to be added to your visa waiver admission in 30 day increments. You can find the how-to’s on satisfactory departure here: https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/immigration-relief-in-emergencies-or-unforeseen-circumstances\n\nDiscretionary everything is hard right now, but it’s not dead, and you sound like a good candidate.

You don’t want them to be able to leverage this against you next time you apply for a visa or such.",

      "text": "My husband has been detained by ICE for about 3 months. He entered the U.S. through CBP One in March 2023 and was detained when he showed up for a scheduled ICE check-in in November 2025.\n\nWe got married in August 2025. I'm a U.S. citizen. I filed the I-130 and I-485 for him - both are pending with USCIS.\n\nSince he entered on parole, he's not eligible for a bond hearing. ICE is the only authority that can release him.\n\nI submitted a humanitarian parole request directly to ICE (Field Office Director, OPLA, the detention facility, and ICE headquarters). \n\nHas anyone successfully gotten humanitarian parole from ICE detention in a similar situation? What worked for you?\n\n* Did having the I-130/I-485 pending help?\n* How long did it take to get a decision?\n* Any tips on what to include or who to contact?\n\nWe're running out of options and his health is declining in detention. Any advice is appreciated.",

      "author": "HeisenDope_883",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "As everyone knows, this is a terrible time to be an immigrant without status in Florida. It’s even frustrating to use the word “illegal,” because a large portion of people actually have **pending status**, waiting for an immigration court date, many with no criminal history (which is my case).\n\nIn my specific situation, I was detained in May 2025 (a friend was pulled over and I was the passenger). I presented my documents confidently, believing everything would be fine, but to my surprise, my “pending” status meant nothing to immigration. According to them, I should have left the country as soon as my tourist visa expired, even though I had already applied for asylum before the deadline. It’s confusing and controversial, but unfortunately, that’s the reality.\n\nAfter spending one month in detention, I was released on a $7,500 bond, with basic conditions such as not possessing drugs, not driving without a driver’s license, etc.\n\nSo far, all conditions have been fully respected, and my status remains exactly the same as before the detention—pending. Objectively speaking, nothing changed in my case. And why does this worry me? Because the reason ICE detained me before is the same reason they could detain me again now, even considering the bond conditions and the fact that I carry the bond paperwork with me 24/7.\n\nAt first, I thought it would be impossible to worry about this again, since I had already gone through the system and been released. However, I consulted two immigration attorneys, and both said I am just as vulnerable as before—without guarantees or protection—until my case is fully resolved.\n\nWith the recent news in Florida, the governor’s support, and the shocking episodes we’ve seen in Minneapolis, it’s at the very least concerning.\n\nNow I would really like to hear other opinions. Is it possible for me to be detained **again**? For the same reason as the first time? Even though it sounds like a silly question, there have been so many absurd situations in the news that I wouldn’t be surprised anymore. I wanted to start a business and work on the road transporting loads, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea.",

It doesn't matter if you have \"no criminal history\", overstaying a tourist visa is grounds for deportation, plain and simple. There's no guarantee you won't be detained again or just deported. There's tons of bogus asylum claimants out there and this administration has demonstrated that they're willing to take a no-nonsense approach. If Haitians can lose TPS when Haiti is an active warzone, then yeah you could be deported. Just voluntarily leave while you still can.",

Not sure why you're asking if you're not going to believe those that know how this works.\n\nIt's not absolutely impossible that your bond is revoked for a reason other than you violating the conditions (which is the only way you could be detained for immigration-related issues at this point), but it's about as low a probability as anything could be.\n\nIt's also likely not quite true that nothing changed in your case. If you have bond, your asylum case very likely switched to defensive asylum through EOIR instead of the USCIS asylum office. If your asylum case is very strong, that may even be a benefit because the USCIS asylum office cannot grant any asylum claims right now but EOIR can--and you'll likely get a faster hearing.

Very few asylum cases are granted, there are about one million green cards capped a year and about thirty five million backlogs, that is gonna mean that most ppl are going to end up in removal proceeding bcs theres no way they let that many ppl in. Under biden ppl came in through the border and said they were seeking asylum and the cbp agents were ordered to take their biometrics and let them in. Also he started different asylum refugee programs like the humanitarian parole where he let thirty thousand ppl a month with little oversight in from cuba, haiti, nicaragua and venezuala if they had a sponser to live and work in the us TEMPORARILY. Americans voted to course correct because eight million illegal immigrants in four years is pretty substantial wouldnt you say? So now trump looks like the bad guy or cleaning up a mess bc Biden decided to make ALOT of promises he couldnt keep. Im just seriously asking bc it seems like alot of ppl that are applying for visas, asylum, green cards etc have alot of contempt for not just being given a golden ticket bc they want one. So im genuinelly curious if you understand this or not? Valuable things dont stay valuable by being easy to get. Again serious question bc Im trying to understand",

Same principle with our tax payer money, it should go to citizens and legal migrants benefit, id rather it be spent on stabilizing our economy and helping ppl with covid loans than taking every illegals bs asylum claim up to the Supreme Court? That's ridiculous, our ppl need help right now! We have done enough and we cant save everyone even if we tried! I would like to see Americans get help now if thats ok.",

At present, the government believes that every non-citizen in the United States must be detained unless they were “admitted” into the country. For example, noncitizens who entered the US on a visa were admitted. But even then, you may still be arrested. That's where due process comes in. So, your best bet is to avoid interaction with any and all federal agencies. Avoid immigration checkpoints; do not travel by plane anywhere; do not enter any federal buildings or spaces (eg military bases). Stay out of trouble with the law. In some jurisdictions, the police may ask your immigration status.",

      "text": "With the current climate of ICE activity and such, I am getting more and more anxious as her arrival date is coming closer.\n\nShe is coming in from Japan to visit me for 1 month, and I'm just nervous. \n\nShe has a ESTA visa, which i know doesn't guarantee entry, but we're doing what we need to obviously. She has a return flight ticket and I have one to fly out to Japan with her for a vacation after the 1 month. She has previously come to the US without issue 2 Christmas seasons ago, so I'm hoping it's ok. lastly, she has a job back in Japan so I'm assuming that helps the border patrol officers understand she has ties back home.\n\n  \nI assume she should be fully honest about her intent of visiting the US, that she's here to see her boyfriend(me) for vacation and sightseeing. But she also intends to take some dance classes and just connect with people, as she is a professional dancer. But she has NO intentions to make money while here, only to maybe collaborate on some creative dance videos which does not generate income at all. \n\nMy question is: how likely is she to get turned away at immigration and if fully sharing the above information to officers, will she be safe?",

I was also nervous so massively over prepared and the only thing I was ever asked to provide was a print out of my return flight. She should answer questions confidently and keep them brief, so say she’s here to visit you and do sightseeing, but she doesn’t need to offer more than that unless she is asked. She should have a print out of her return ticket, and ideally a letter from her employer stating what date she is expected back at work. She could also bring a copy of any lease or property deeds if possible. I think that mentioning she is going to collaborate on dance videos may not be the best idea, as that feels like it’s edging towards work even if it’s not. She shouldn’t lie of course, but she doesn’t need to offer this detail up if she isn’t asked.",

      "text": "My fiancé was detained by customs and is now currently detained by ICE and in removal proceedings because of a domestic dispute and possession of THC (gummies) charge in 2018 (both misdemeanors). Been an LPR since 2015, but been living in the US since 2002 (came illegally around 12 years old). I have reached out to a bunch of different attorneys and they all seem to say different things/options for him. The office I planned to go with were terrible with communication. Never called me back regarding his case or if they would be willing to help after reviewing his case. I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt due to the holiday season. My fiancé then had his first hearing (no attorney showed) and the judge advised him to complete an I-601 waiver of inadmissibility form and bring it to his next hearing, which was scheduled about 2 weeks later. In the meantime, because of the no show and no response from the law office, I decided to reach out to MORE attorneys. One said he could try for bond (already been told he does not qualify) and that he could complete the waiver form, but the processing time is up to 2-3 years. I’ve also been told that he wouldn’t be eligible for the form. Well, fast forward a little bit, the initial attorney I planned to go with called me and apologized. He told me he believes his case is not a case of a controlled substance and wanted to file a motion to terminate proceedings. Also offered to go to his next hearing (which was the following day) without charging me and present this to the judge. Of course, the judge is going to allow him to file the motion, but before I pay this attorney $10,000, I would like to hear some thoughts on this. I have an extremely difficult time trusting attorneys, and I want the best opportunity for my fiancé. I’m not even sure if he would be eligible for the waiver. We aren’t legally married, his parents aren’t legal. He does have US citizen children though. Also, my fiancé wasn’t able to go to the second hearing because he was transferred to another facility and they didn’t process paperwork in time. I asked the attorney questions, but they do not give direct answers. I basically want to know under what grounds would they file the motion? Both state (where the conviction was) and federal law say THC is a controlled substance. There is the 30g exception, which he did not have 30g on him, but with the exact quantity not listed on his court documents, does that help or hurt his case? What would you do? How often are cases like this terminated?",

Do you have the actual charges they are alleging? You make it sound like he has a conviction for domestic violence and some kind of drug offense. I'd be curious how they charged him.

You are saying a \"domestic charge\" and a \"THC charge.\" Your later posts reveal these are convictions, not charges. To accurately understand and advise, you have to know the names of the exact charges he was convicted on, the dates (you said 2018, which is within 3 years of admission as a LPR), the specific provision of the penal code, and the state where he was convicted of these offenses. A \"domestic charge\" can mean anything from a conviction on an charge of domestic violence to a disorderly conduct conviction which was domestic in nature. \n\nThese seemingly small distinctions are what matter if you are looking for accurate advice and guidance.",

The attorney I spoke with said he is not concerned about the domestic battery, and he believes he can prove that the THC possession is not a crime of a controlled substance. This is why I’m confused… because both state and federal law say THC is a controlled substance, so I’m not sure how he would go about that. Not sure if it’s worth it. The attorney also told me he is not eligible to apply for the I-601 waiver. ",

      "title": "Girl I'm talking to has asylum hearing. Chances of this working out?",
      "author": "PathfinderNebula77",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "I met this Colombian girl about 5 months ago through mutual friends at a party. Since then, we started texting and hanging out often, working out together, game nights and outings with friends, helped her with rides to work. She's welcomed me into her home many times, cooked for me, introduced me to her friends here and ones back in home over facetime.  \n   \nI find her pretty flighty and inconsistent (I'm in my early 30s, her early 20s), I understand she is very busy working 2 jobs. She's generally been affectionate, fun, and hospitable towards me when do get together. She also told me during one of my visits that this year she hopes to get married. I have not yet made any direct moves towards being in a relationship, as I've been taking my time just getting to know her while I get my life in order since recently moving in with my mother, starting a part-time job while I get my career back on track and pay off my debts. She's not fully aware of my situation but has the impression that I'm pretty stable.\n\nAs far as what I know about her immigration status, she came here under asylum. As of now, she's been in US for 1 year, in the process of getting an SSN. She was detained by ICE once early in her arrival but let go. Had one court hearing. Her 2nd court hearing is 1.5 months away, and a 3rd after that.\n\nAs I was taking her home one night last week, she told me about her 2 upcoming court dates and hesitantly asked me if I'd be willing to marry her and even offered to pay... I've been keen about her situation but still felt kind of blindsided, especially since I was literally intending on finally having a talk with her about starting a relationship. I told her I would not accept any money but that we should talk about this later. But I'm not willing to marry at all under these circumstances, so I've been researching lawyers that could help her case. But I'm now questioning whether she is still even into me the way I thought she was or if it's possible to separate romance from her situation at all. It honestly felt discouraging, even though everything else hasn't really seemed to change between us.\n\nOur mutual friends have let me know that she does like me, and the mutual attraction seemed evident, and we've gotten fairly close these past 5 months. I do like her very much, and find her to be an overall good person, and would like to do whatever I reasonably can to make her stay. Even if we get married and I file an I-130, I'm worried that the timeline might raise eyebrows since she is in court removal proceedings. And despite evidence of a bond between us, we are not in a relationship with any shared bills or anything that would strengthen our case. And financially, I'm not in the best spot right now yet if that's going to be an important detail when filing an I-485, or with filing any forms in general The timing of everything just seems bad while we deal with our own individual pressures :(",

First, I will visit friends in Winnipeg, Canada, and afterwards visit friends in Oregon. I have two flight options going from Winnipeg to Oregon: \n\n1. Winnipeg - Minneapolis - Seattle - Redmond (OR)  \n2. Winnipeg - Vancouver - Seattle - Redmond (OR)\n\nAs of my understanding, I will go through CBP pre-clearance at either Winnipeg airport if I choose option 1, or Vancouver airport if I choose option 2. Due to hearing a lot about ICE in Minneapolis in the media recently, I have been wondering whether they also target regular tourists and whether it would be better to choose the flight option via Vancouver? \n\nAny opinions or experiences at either airport pre-clearances and/or Minneapolis airport are greatly appreciated :)",

In my experience, I’ve seldom had a wait at Winnipeg preclearance, and it usually took 5-10 minutes at most to go from security to the gate. Anything you’ve heard in the news about Minneapolis shouldn’t be a concern for you since you would have been lawfully admitted that same day and you’re just connecting through.",

        "body": "*From Bloomberg News Reporters Sophie Alexander and Fola Akinnibi*\n\nDespite protests in small towns and cities across the US, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with the purchase of warehouses it plans to convert into immigration jails in what could be the largest expansion of such detention capacity in US history.\n\nThe cost for acquiring two warehouses alone was $172 million. A third in El Paso, Texas, could be among the largest jails of any kind in the country if completed as envisioned, with 8,500 beds. The deals mark the latest turn in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plan to use as many as 23 warehouses for detaining thousands of immigrants arrested by federal agents in Minneapolis and other cities. Those aggressive enforcement actions have ignited clashes with protesters and led to agents killing two US citizens.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the administration paid $102 million for a site near Hagerstown, Maryland, according to a local court filing. A week later, the government paid $70 million in cash for a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona. The price tags — roughly in line with the industry average for the warehouse market — cover just the acquisition of the sites, which are currently empty shells. ICE still has to pay companies to outfit the buildings with toilets, showers, beds, dining and recreation areas and then run them as detention centers.\n\n[Read the full story here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/us-spends-hundreds-of-millions-on-warehouses-for-ice-detention-centers)",

I’m not sure what would happen in that case.  That would likely be even worse than it being in your own name.  If it’s legally in your name even if you’re here illegally then you should still be able to coordinate with someone stateside to sell it or ship the small stuff to you.",

Keep in mind his attorney filed three petitions in November 2025: COR, Asylum, VAWA. \n\nThe judge denied COR &amp; Asylum, but granted him relief via VAWA. \n\nHere is what doesn’t make any sense:\n\n\\-he is on supervised release I-220B and must wear a GPS ankle monitor\n\n\\-he must register for substance abuse program within 14 days and show proof to ICE w/i 30 days\n\n\\-he must register for sexual deviancy counseling program within 14 days and show proof to ICE w/i 30 days\n\n\\-he \\*may\\* have to register as a sex offender within 7 days\n\n\\-he must report to all in-person ICE appts\n\nWhat is the burden if “proof” VAWA applicants must show the IJ in order to get relief granted? Not once did I ever touch a hair on his head, as I am not a violent person. \n\nMy ex spouse is no victim of anything, as I filed for divorce back in 2020, and he got arrested for domestic abuse, and got slapped with a restraining order due to threatening me in our then shared home. He was found in contempt of court in family court for multiple incidents back in 2024. \n\nIt’s outrageous. My abuser walks free meanwhile immigrants with zero criminal history are getting deported left and right. \n\nEither DHS didn’t do their job or his attorney (well known attorney) lied and successfully painted his client as a victim of imaginary abuse.

I suspect the conditions were imposed because they don't truly believe he has a valid vawa case, but because he filed it they have to proceed like it is valid- until it's found not. Does that make sense?\n\nThe good news is they gave him a bunch of restrictions and once the vawa is denied he'll be eligible for deportation again. You can typically only pull that trick once. There are procedures to prevent fraudulent filings to buy time. \n\nI would reach out to your congressman. Ideally they inquire and someone perhaps checks his pending vawa case. Perhaps it's then pushed to the top or otherwise assigned to an Officer to process sooner than later. Obviously not any kind of official expedite, just a we are interested and going to be watching and following up on this kind of pressure.",

This person has legal status but no green card.\n\nThe fear is, obviously, that they would be detained as soon as they show up. Not showing up technically jeopardizes the green card application.\n\nHas anyone Minnesota received this form, attended an interview, or returned from an interview recently? Any information or experiences would be extremely appreciated. They are trying to keep this person safe.",

I’m trying to be realistic and not waste money on options that have little chance of success.\n\nFacts:\n\n\t•\tHe’s been detained by ICE for almost 2 months\n\n\t•\tBond hearing already happened and was denied yesterday \n\n\t•\tJudge denied bond citing:\n\n\t•\t“Danger to the community” based on driving without a license, expired plates, and moving from Texas to Florida\n\n\t•\tIn the alternative, flight risk\n\n\t•\tJudge also said he has “limited speculative relief” in immigration court\n\n\t•\tNo violent crimes, no drugs, no DUIs. In his fiancée and I’m a US citizen \n\n\t•\tJudge did not say detention was mandatory, just discretionary denial\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t1.\tIs habeas corpus even realistic at this stage, or is \\~2 months way too early for a federal court to care?\n\n\t2.\tWould a bond redetermination make sense if we can provide new evidence (sponsor, affidavit not to drive, transportation plan, etc.)?\n\n\t3.\tIs a BIA bond appeal usually more cost-effective than habeas in situations like this?\n\n\t4.\tFor people who’ve done habeas successfully — how long was the detention before filing?\n\nWe’ve already been quoted $5k+ for habeas, so I’m trying to make the smartest decision, not an emotional one.\n\nAny insight from attorneys, former detainees, or family members who’ve gone through this would really help. Thank you.",

A federal court is not likely to scrutinize that finding as it would have to go through the BIA first. \n\nThe only reason we are getting these habeas orders is because the government is reinterpreting 30 years of standard immigration court practice and stretching the plain meaning of the law to claim someone who has been here for 20 years or whatever is \"seeking admission\". \n\nNormal denials of bond based on flight risk or danger would not be extraordinary in that sense for the federal court to get involved. \n\nHow did your BF enter the country?",

You need to appeal to the BIA, as a federal court doesn’t really have much they can do as the detention is not per se unlawful. Habeas, like the above commenter said, is for unlawful detentions (not necessarily unjust ones). If the BIA denies an appeal you could then consider habeas, again, depending on the grounds and reasons.\n\nThe reasons for danger to the community sound like a stretch but unfortunately limited relief in immigration court is grounds for flight risk denials especially for more conservative judges.",

      "author": "zkyblu3",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "I posted here last month about my husband, who was recently deported. He assaulted my toddler and me and was charged. ICE became aware (you can read between the lines here) and promptly detained him. He was deported a few weeks later. \n\nHe is a convicted felon who was in prison in his home country for high-level fraud (more than 10,000 counts of misdemeanor fraud and ~40 counts of felony fraud). He concealed this when he applied for ESTA, which is how he was able to enter. He then filed a frivolous asylum claim since he didn't qualify for any other immigration benefits due to the criminal history.\n\nHe was deported through expedited removal, technically due to an overstay (his I94 expired in May and he submitted his asylum application less than 6 months later). I was told he would have a 10-year bar.\n\nICE obtained court documents from his home country regarding his fraud conviction (again, you can read between the lines). They advised those would be kept in his file and visible if he ever tried to return. \n\n...And he is trying to return. He's been reaching out to pro bono immigration organizations saying he was coerced into signing removal documents, was denied an interpreter, was denied a hearing, etc. \n\nWith all the bad publicity surrounding ICE, I'm afraid some people believe that everyone who was deported recently was wronged - and I'm worried a lawyer could pity him and try to help him back here. He is not being honest with lawyers about anything (the criminal charges in the US, his prior convictions in his home country, etc). He's trying to make it out like ICE broke up our family and we desperately want him back. In reality, we are safe and happy with him gone.\n\nIt's giving me so much anxiety, and I'm wondering what his chances are realistically of fighting his deportation and coming back here. Anyone with knowledge on things like this, I would love to learn your input. Thank you!\n\nAlso - does anyone know how I can get his foreign criminal records to USCIS? I know ICE has them but want to make sure USCIS does too. I submitted a tip form but there was no way to upload documents. (If anyone works for USCIS and would be able to accept them, I'd be happy to send them your way.)\n\nFWIW, I'm a dual citizen and a big supporter of immigration. People like my husband shouldn't be allowed to take a spot from those who deserve to be here. ",

Even if he somehow challenged the procedure by which he was deported (and there’s not really a way to do that from outside the US - it’s more a thing that gets raised as a defense to criminal illegal reentry charges for border crossers), he’d still be inadmissible and deportable for any number of other reasons.\n\nIt is quite unlikely under current circumstances that he’d be able to illegally cross successfully from Canada or Mexico even if he could get there, and if he did, getting caught with a past deportation would mean he’d be facing serious criminal consequences for illegal reentry.\n\nIn short, he really is gone and it is extremely unlikely he could come back.

        "body": "I wish for two things:\n\n1.  That we stop using the term \"extensive vetting process\" when talking about people from countries without functioning, modern governments.  If some random person shows up from a village in western Burkina Faso, how do you know they were never a part of JNIM?  Their fingerprints aren't going to be in some magic database that you can search.  It's unlikely that the U.S. possesses a photo of this person that would tie them to anyone else already flagged.  Then they are put into a refugee camp, which are generally run by the UNHCR (meaning that all the work is done by NGOs).  The UNHCR has no police force and no mechanism to collect meaningful data on who may or may not be committing crimes.  The police from countries like Kenya, Bangladesh, and Jordan handle actual law enforcement, and if you think they put much effort into investigating and prosecuting crimes that happen in refugee camps, I've got news for you.  Then at some point this person is fingerprinted, interviewed, and given a visa.  Which brings us to 2.\n\n2.  People need to educate themselves on the immigration system if they want to have meaningful discourse rather than shouting at each other.  These refugees received visas, yes.  That allowed them to enter the United States and apply for an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident after 1 year.  This is different than normal immigrant visas, where the visa holder becomes a Legal Permanent Resident the moment they are admitted to the United States.  I think that the administration is taking an overly heavy-handed approach, but until these people have adjusted status, they do not have an unqualified right to be inside the United States.  The administration has a number of levers that they can use here, such as INA 207(c)(4), which states that *\"the Secretary of Homeland Security may terminate refugee status if the alien was not in fact a refugee at the time of admission or has become ineligible\".*",

Not sure why but thats impeding. The second he went in front of that women to save her or help her he made physical contact. If a law enforcement officer pushes someone and you throw your body in front of them you are breaking the law. Now everything he was doing would be typically impeding officers as it was an active scene and from the newly released footage there was a much longer verbal altercation which we know if we have had contact with a police that if you get pulled over you follow orders or if someone is getting arrested you dont approach the officers and when they repetitively tell you to get back you continue to approach and ignore orders. Then after sprayed with mace he did not put his hand behinds his back and submit to being arrested. He also had a gun on him during this that was found throughout this altercation which is an extra factor when impeding LEO.\n\nI do not think he should have been shot as I think there was something that happened after they screamed \"GUn GUN GUN\" that made them panic and shoot. But the people in Minnesota have been following cops, blowing whistles, blocking them in with cars, showing up to their hotels, throwing crap at them and ambushing them in restaurants. I dont think any of that is lawful or something that ought to be allowed. During raids police whether local or state deal with civilians and ICE deal with what they are there to do. We see now in Minnesota they have state law enforcement doing exactly that. Why was Minnesota or Minneapolis police not enforcing law the past 4 weeks is not known but ICE should have not had to deal with civilians who were impeding them the entire time. If we look at footage from the last few nights these are not people standing there with a sign, these are people attacking businesses expected to be ICE involved and those who guard them. They have destroyed their own neighbors and come at them a thugs and have hurt Ice officers. Why they are allowed to do this or how they have gotten to ever believe this is a way of protest I do not know but it is something seen before in that exact city.",

So now obviously most of those claims are going to be denied. Also he started different asylum refugee programs like the humanitarian parole where he let thirty thousand ppl a month with little oversight in from cuba, haiti, nicaragua and venezuala if they had a sponser to live and work in the us TEMPORARILY. Americans voted to course correct because eight million illegal immigrants in four years is pretty substantial wouldnt you say?

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m hoping to hear from others who may have gone through something similar.\n\nMy uncle is currently in ICE detention. Last Thursday, his assigned ICE officer went to speak with him directly. According to my uncle, the officer explained that he is approaching 90 days in detention and asked questions about how he was detained and his background. The officer mentioned that because my uncle has no criminal history, he wanted to check with his supervisor to see if my uncle could be released with an ankle monitor so ICE can track his location without him remaining detained.\n\nWe were told that my uncle is supposed to have an interview this upcoming Tuesday to determine whether he qualifies for release from the detention center under an alternative to detention (ankle monitor). This interview was initiated by ICE, not requested by an attorney, and it is not a bond hearing.\n\nI’m trying to understand how common this is and what it might lead to. Specifically:\n\n* Has anyone else’s loved one had a similar ICE interview while detained?\n* Was it related to release with an ankle monitor or another alternative to detention?\n* Did it result in release, and if so, how long did it take to hear a decision after the interview?\n\nI’m not looking for legal advice, just hoping to hear real experiences so I can better understand what this process looks like.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n",

        "body": "I was a supervisor over an ICE ATD program, but those weren't my primary duties. My officers basically ran the program and interacted with the contract company, but I am vaguely familiar with it. If someone isn't going to be deported within 90 days after being taken into custody or he is ordered removed, we have to get authorization from the field office to detain post 90 days pending removal efforts. Part of that process is an interview that the officer compiles to see if we should detain or release the detainee on Order of Supervision. The Field Office Director can order release to include conditions such as the need for an OSUP bond or Alternatives To Detention. Basically, if released on ATD, they get the ankle monitor and need a phone (At least that's how it was before I retired). I forgot totally how it worked (6+ years ago), but I thought the app will send out alerts, and then you need to take a picture of your face to confirm it's you. The contract company also had people report in person and they would do home visits to make sure the person lived there. I'm kind of thinking not all people released on ATD got the ankle bracelet, but I forgot what the options were. We were releasing a lot of people pending court, but did use it on final order cases too if we thought we could remove the person. If I had to bet, they will order continued detention at day 90, and that extends it another 90 days. At that point, only HQ can order continued detention at day 180.",

Usually someone released on ATD complicated removal efforts so we'd generally keep as many detained as possible until removal. If we know we just aren't going to be able to remove someone, we'd OSUP as fast as possible. Law states we cannot release certain classes of aliens before day 90. We used to have a bunch of agg felon Cubans that we'd have to keep in custody, then write these post order custody reviews. It was a big waste of time, effort, and money knowing they were going to be released on day 90. The second part of your question, is basically ICE will hold people dependent on their detention resources and there is no hard rule. If ICE is short on beds and they are getting mandatory custody cases from the local jails, they'll free up beds by placing them on one of the ATD programs. When ICE started up ISAP with contracted companies, there was a big push to utilize the program since we were already paying the company and it was supposed to free up ICE staff. The FOD and AFOD direct overall detention usage and will order release, but a SDDO usually oversees the officers that handle release with any ATD conditions.",

The problem comes from identity theft. Its easy to manipulate an id card to show the name of person A with the photo of person B. As long as you have a government issued ID with your picture on it, how can I verify that the social you handed me is really yours? I can't. There is not a database (at least that I'm aware of) that will give me a photo of the person who's social I put in. So I HAVE to assume they are who they say they are.\n\nThat being said, I do think there needs to be some sort of punishment for companies who hire undocumented or those who do not have the right to work here. We have had people come in (as recently has 4 months ago) with a significant other and ask if we would hire him but use her info as if we were paying her. We said no.

They had planned to get married after the baby was born but now we’re trying to navigate what to do. What’s the best way to find the best lawyer?? His NTA is February 3rd in Elizabeth, NJ but he is still being held in our local jail. An ice agent gave us an A number but it was for another person with a similar name. I’m not sure how to go about that?? His I-862 does not have his A number listed. He’s the primary provider for his fiancé, newborn son, and 10 year old (almost) stepson. They live in his home and he’s worked and paid bills since coming to the US in 2023. Any help pointing us in the right direction is greatly appreciated!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo his NTA on 2/3 wasn’t put into the EOIR system so he didn’t have a hearing. We have also gotten his correct A number. We have had consults with several lawyers and organizations that say we definitely have a habeas case.. but we are having trouble finding a lawyer. We have one but he said he’d file it Monday and didn’t.. and now he’s on vacation out of the country for two weeks. Everywhere we call/email either doesn’t respond or says they aren’t taking new cases. He was also in the local jail until today, ICE came and got him today and his paperwork had Moshannon (PA) and Elizebeth (NJ) listed on it so we aren’t sure where he’s going.",

      "text": "Hello, I am DACA, paroled into the US November 2024 through San Ysidro. I’ve had DACA from the beginning. I was renewing my permit this week and under a question about leaving the country, I mentioned I went out on advance parole, then was prompted for the I-94 number. I never received one when I was paroled. I checked on the cbp website and input my information, passport, full name, I even tired my a number but there is no information or i94 number. I was told by cbp to go to a differed site in Los Angeles but I’m too scared to go and risk getting picked up by ice. Does anyone have any advice or relatable information ?\n\nThank you ",

We are urgently seeking recommendations for experienced, reputable immigration attorneys, particularly those skilled in bond re-evaluations and deportation defense.\n\nHere is the context we have (respecting their privacy):\n\n\t•\tHe has no criminal record.\n\n\t•\tHe is legally married to his husband (a U.S. citizen, I believe).\n\n\t•\tHe has significant ties to the community: a valid driver's license, and owns a home.\n\n\t•\tHe had a bond hearing but it was denied.\n\n\t•\tWe were informed that a family member filed charges against him (described as \"bogus\"), which appears to have initiated the process.\n\nHis husband is understandably overwhelmed. We are trying to compile a list of lawyers or legal service organizations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that specialize in complex deportation cases, especially where bond was initially denied and where there may be avenues for relief based on marriage and community ties.",

Under Trump, that has dropped to about ~9,000 per month.

The National Guard and Marines were also deployed illegally against the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 against immigrants, and Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a wartime act last evoked during WW2.\n\nI genuinely believe that this isn't just 2 conflicting opinions.

      "author": "Okay-computing",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "To give you a summary of our situation: \n\nI am 22 and am a part-time student who has been working under my dad's company since I was 17, and I meet the minimum salary requirements for sponsoring my mom's citizenship and I even have the house we live in under my name. \n\n\n\nMy mom entered the country legally but overstayed. She first came here in the early 2000's but left to see her family around 2014, but returned again in 2018 with no issues (I'm not sure how?) and has remained here ever since. She has no criminal record and hasn't really done much here. The original plan was for my dad to sponsor her but he ended up remarrying so that is no longer an option, but he has offered to pay for the lawyer costs and any other extra costs during the immigration process. \n\n\n\nIronically she is completely in support of how the current government's is handling immigration, but she seems suddenly hesitant to start a case after trying to search for a lawyer and hearing my dad say that they have ICE officers sitting in immigration offices at the moment even though it was never this way before. That and he seems convinced it's not worth the risk (as she would then be placed in their systems?) given that ICE is knocking on doors. My mom feels stuck because she's wanted to get this started for years and have the freedom to work and move around.\n\n\n\nBut (and forgive my ignorance if this seems naive) I think that given the fact that my mom does not have a criminal record, she's being sponsored by her daughter (not a spouse so marriage fraud is less likely), and that we don't live in an area with lots of immigrants, that it is unlikely that we would ever be on ICE's radar. I've also heard people say that our state is a \"sanctuary state\" but I'm not sure if that means anything anymore.\n\n\n\nI'm really interested in seeing what people who know more about how the current government's policies have affected the immigration process might have to say in regards to our specific case. In truth, I have not done much research on the immigration process beyond the bare minimum as I expected my parents to have handled most of it for me and to tell me what I would need to do.\n\n\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",

So +10 years from her departure date, and that bar is served. \n\nThe permanent bar is only triggered on an additional entry without inspection.

While detaining those that eventually have to be released may not be the best use of immigration detention resources, the administration has both been given a lot more beds, and also seems to view such detention as a deterrent and/or punishment for breaking immigration law.\n\nWhichever path forward she takes, an immigration lawyer is a must.",

That's just my opinion though based on our current SCOTUS.\n\nEdit: clarified my opinion",

Traditionally ICE needed consent, exigent circumstances, or a judicial warrant to force entry into a home.\nBut the legal basis they’re relying on now isn’t completely made-up. It’s an extension of existing 4th Amendment exceptions:\n•  Plain view / automobile exception: Cop sees drugs or a gun in plain sight in your car, they can search without a warrant.\n•  Hot pursuit / exigent circumstances: Police are chasing a known violent felon who runs into a house, they can enter without waiting for a warrant.\nIn this case, ICE now treats the administrative warrant plus probable cause that a removable alien is inside as creating the functional equivalent of exigent circumstances. They’re saying: “We have PC that an illegal is present right now, same as chasing a fugitive.”\nWhether courts ultimately bless this broader use of admin warrants is still being litigated, but the doctrinal hook they’re using isn’t brand new. It’s stretching existing exceptions that already let cops enter homes or search cars based on probable cause plus urgency without a judge’s signature.",

Magistrate judges exercise the jurisdiction of the district court to the extent allowed by statute, local rule, and in some cases, consent of the parties in the case. So theoretically a magistrate judge could lawfully issue a removal order under the right circumstances.\n\nI think entering a home after a judicial removal order has been granted is the government's strongest possible case here. But judicial removal orders are rare, and the alien involved should be in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons anyways, so it's not a situation I would expect to ever come up in practice.",

No mandates, no tracking of stuff or whatever...\n\nIf you have a very strict comprehension of the rights, I can understand that. Me personally I like that Trump currently is more pragmatic about things, because \"these people\" don't play fair either. For example Russia's shadow fleet isn't fair game, China fishing at the sea border of very poor African countries, effectively starving them, isn't fair game. I think the West acting on a very high morale hasn't been beneficial for us over the last decades. We should keep our high morale standards, but the way to achieve that could be more flexible maybe.",

Keep in mind that even criminals and people knowingly harboring them can’t usually be arrested in their home without a judicial warrant unless an exception applies, and civil immigration violations are supposedly a less serious situation.\n\nAlso we aren’t discussing whether or not an order of some kind is needed - even ICE agrees that at least an administrative warrant is usually needed to enter a home without consent.

                            "body": "Administrative warrants are not used to arrest - arrest is a criminal law term, and in that context it's clearly settled law that a judicial warrant is absolutely required in any context where the 4A requires a warrant at all. ICE's administrative warrant procedures are for non-criminal detentions and removals only. If they want to prosecute someone criminally, they have to involve a judge for a judicial warrant or else determine that a normal criminal law exception to the warrant requirement applies.\n\nMy own view is that an administrative warrant does not satisfy 4A requirements even for immigration enforcement purposes, but also that it does effectively count as granting the detaining ICE agent the necessary authorities under federal (non-constitutional) statutes and regulations and policies such that they are acting within their non-constitutional authority, for purposes of not being personally disciplinable for acting against policy and probably also for purposes of falling within immunity from state-level criminal prosecution if that would otherwise apply (e.g. criminal trespass laws).\n\n(Despite what VP Vance said, their immunity from state-level criminal prosecution is not absolute under current SCOTUS Supremacy Clause precedent, but it does cover necessary and proper actions within the scope of their authority under the (federal) laws of the US. He's got a Yale law degree and some experience as a practicing lawyer, so he's either knowingly lying to the media about this or at the very least being reckless in not checking the law first.)\n\nRegardless of whether the courts eventually agree with my view above, under current SCOTUS qualified immunity precedent, the ICE officer would definitely be immune from any personal liability under a federal section 1983 civil rights lawsuit because this 4A question is legally unsettled.",

Thanks for the correction.\n\n&gt;  1983 by its explicit wording does not apply to federal officers so that section is not applicable to ICE. So it's not qualified immunity that prevents a lawsuit, it's sovereign immunity (which is absolute).\n\nAgain, thanks for the correction that section 1983 is irrelevant, but sovereign immunity does not absolutely protect federal agents from either civil or criminal consequences.\n\nIn the civil lawsuit context, SCOTUS has repeatedly declined to extend the scope of *Bivens* lawsuits much beyond the original facts of the *Bivens* case, but even SCOTUS hasn't yet outright rejected their prior precedent where someone can successfully sue a federal officer for violation of their constitutional rights, and new cases which are sufficiently similar to *Bivens* occasionally get past their recent skepticism of the category overall.\n\nAnd in the criminal context, yes, Minnesota can prosecute the agent who shot and killed Renee Good if they think it violated state criminal law, *if* they can fit within the Supremacy Clause immunity exception I outlined, and of course if they can prove the criminal case itself. Supremacy Clause immunity only applies if the officer was \"reasonably acting within the bounds of their lawful federal duties.\" If the officer acted contrary to written ICE policy guidelines for how they must behave, it's very possible that the officer was acting outside of those bounds and is therefore not immune to state criminal prosecution.\n\nHere is a white paper from 2025 about this topic:\n\nhttps://statedemocracy.law.wisc.edu/featured/2025/explainer-can-states-prosecute-federal-officials/\n\nIn the wake of the Renee Good shooting, here is a law professor analysis, with lots of citations, showing that federal officers have been found amenable to state prosecution on a variety of cases, although certainly not most of the time:\n\nhttps://reason.com/volokh/2026/01/09/what-kind-of-immunity-for-ice-agents/\n\nFederal officer immunity is strong but definitely not absolute.\n\n&gt; How does it count for statutory purposes but not for constitutional purposes? That would make the relevant statute unconstitutional and void. That's a contradiction and isn't how constitutional law works.\n\nI agree in general, but I just meant that it might be viewed as an acceptable defense in specific cases: (1) less relevant to the current political context, internal executive branch disciplinary proceedings; and (2) more relevant nowadays, also for the purpose of Supremacy Clause immunity as \"*reasonably* [if inaccurately] acting within the bounds of their lawful federal duties\" similar to the good-faith exception to fourth amendment suppression rules.\n\nI do think it's fair that a federal officer shouldn't be personally punished for complying with a statutory and regulatory and policy framework that they have no reasonable way of knowing is unconstitutional, even though (as you say) the statute is certainly void for most purposes if the statute is in fact unconstitutional.",

She is currently out of status because her change of status recently got rejected because of misrepresentation, she’s preparing for asylum application but it’s not submitted yet. Her attorney said this NTA is very weird and he has never seen this before, and he is worried this is a new tactic by the ICE to lure people in for detention.\n\nHas anyone been in similar situation recently? Any suggestion what’s the best strategy to take in this situation?\n\nThis is at Oakland CA",

        "body": "Immigration attorney here. I’m very sorry you’re dealing with this, especially while deployed.\n\nUnfortunately, deferred action does not prevent ICE detention and can be revoked even while Military Parole in Place is pending. That is likely why this occurred.\n\nThat said, a pending Military Parole in Place case combined with your active duty status is a strong humanitarian and military equity, and these cases can sometimes be resolved with fast, focused advocacy.\n\nKey steps right now:\n\n1. Confirm your father’s detention location and A-number using the ICE detainee locator or by calling U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n2. Contact a military legal assistance office (JAG). They are familiar with Military Parole in Place and can help elevate these cases, even while you’re deployed.\n3. Ask for help from organizations or counsel experienced with detained cases involving military families, as timing and framing are critical.\n4. Gather documentation showing your active duty status and deployment, the PIP filing, and any prior deferred action approvals.\n\nThis is urgent but not hopeless. Military family cases often hinge on speed and clear presentation of service-related equities. But this is general information only, not case-specific advice.",

If they did not want a class of individuals to be subject to enforcement, they could write that just as easily in law.\n\nYour disagreement is with the administration's policy decisions, which is entirely reasonable.

The problem is that they have wide latitude to BS that reasonable suspicion to make it appear as if it was not just random or purely racial in nature. There is also nothing preventing them from talking to people in the street and using their presence as an intimidation to make people feel obligated to respond. \n\nIf you see that video where the lady says she is a citizen rather than directly answer their questions about where she was born, they ended up leaving because they knew they had no reasonable suspicion to actually detain her. If she would have said she was born in another country, combined with other factors, they could have then detained her and forced her to prove her citizenship status. \n\nHence they will just go up to people and ask them certain questions to then trigger reasonable suspicion. \n\nMost of the time they will get away with it because a citizen or legal resident will tend to provide ID and get the situation over with as soon as possible. \n\nEven if they detain you for say 30min the average person will be glad to leave and will probably not have the time, money or resources to contact an attorney that could even begin to formulate a mechanism to hold them accountable. Even then the Courts are unlikely to do anything if there was nothing but a momentary inconvenience. \n\nA person would have to physically injured or detained for an unreasonable period of time so that there would be a deep scrutiny and examination for the initial stop. \n\nThe main thing that has always curtailed this stuff is the leadership and individual officers who at least before, wanted to adhere to the Constitution. \n\nNow they think that the Constitution (which they swore to uphold) is just a hinderance and no big deal since the legal immigrant or citizen goes free anyway.",

      "text": "Recently my father was taken into custody by ICE. This was back in November 2025 and his hearing wasnt set until January 2026. He finally has his master hearing not too long ago and was finally ordered a removal. He was at the same detention center for about a week agter his hearing and was later moved to a processing center. I thought once an order of removal was made the process to deport somone to their country was fairly quick. I've been reading online though and some websites say that he will continue to be detanied until the 30 day appeal window closes. Is this still true in 2026? Why would they move him locations if they keep people 30 days after the removal order? No one ever knows how anything works until it happens to you so we dont know if this js true and of it is he didnt waive his right to appeal, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have even understood it even if je was told so is there any way to waive the right to appeal now, is there somome he can tell or ask for while at the processingcenter or dentention center if they move him again? We didn't have the money or time for a lawyer so we're kinda left to our own devices. ",

How much can the lawyer push? ICE gave him a document that says we are in touch with the consulate…but that’s pretty much it. Feel terrible the passport is lost like this.. ",

Elections have consequences. \n\nThere is a remedy, and it does not involve stalking, obstructing, assaulting, or killing federal officers. In fact it is illegal to use those methods and an alien who does or advocates for it, is inadmissible.\n\nInstead the remedy is the ballot box. \n\nFrom 2009-2017, America had a president who ruthlessly exploited his keen knowledge of the constitution to expel non citizens in record numbers and drone U.S. citizens who directed non citizens to come to the U.S. to commit acts that make them removable (such as a terrorism).\n\nRather than be appalled in 2017, \ninstead the electorate in 2017 said: More!",

They also said that they could have arrested her but didnt. This family member is not legal and can not obtain a drivers license. Can she plead guilty and pay the fine online? We are scared for them to go to court and get arrested there and detained by ice because they cant provide a license and show that they are legal. I know talking to a lawyer is the thing to do but this just happened and im scared for them.",

      "text": "I’m in removal proceedings and I’m really anxious about what happens next, so I’m looking for guidance and strategy ideas (not individual legal advice).\n\nHere’s the general situation (no personal identifiers):\n\nI’m a survivor of abuse.\n\nI have both a VAWA self‑petition (I‑360) and a U visa (I‑918) pending with USCIS.\n\nI have a U‑visa bona fide determination and work authorization.\n\nI have had a VAWA prima facie determination in the past (renewal timing is a bit confusing).\n\nI am in immigration court, in removal proceedings for being out of status.\n\nWith counsel, a motion to terminate was already filed based on the pending VAWA and U visa. DHS opposed termination and the immigration judge denied it. Now I’m trying to figure out what realistic options still exist so I’m not removed while these survivor‑based applications are being processed.\n\nI’ve heard about, but don’t fully understand the practical chances of:\n\nAdministrative closure under the 2024 EOIR rule (8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(c) – “Efficient Case and Docket Management”) as a way to pause the case while USCIS handles the VAWA/U‑visa.​\n\nContinuances based on Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&amp;N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012) for people with pending U visas, especially when there’s already a bona fide determination and EAD.​\n\nProsecutorial discretion (PD) from the ICE/OPLA attorney, asking them not to oppose, or even join, a request for administrative closure/continuance (or termination later), especially in survivor cases.​\n\nMy questions for those with experience (lawyers or people who have gone through this):\n\nAfter a denied motion to terminate, what have you seen work more often in similar VAWA/U‑visa survivor cases:\n\nAdministrative closure,\n\nLong continuances, or\n\nWaiting for a big change (like I‑360 or U approval) before filing anything new?\n\nHave you seen judges actually use the 2024 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(c) &amp; (d) tools in practice for survivors with pending VAWA/U visas? Did it help to emphasize USCIS’s exclusive jurisdiction and humanitarian equities?​\n\nIn real life, how often do OPLA attorneys change their position and grant PD (for example, not opposing closure/continuance) after they already opposed termination once? Any tips on what kind of evidence or equities tend to move them (cooperation with law enforcement, mental health, community ties, etc.)?​\n\nIs it worth involving a congressional office to make inquiries or support the idea that the person should be allowed to remain while VAWA and U‑visa cases are pending?\n\nAny high‑level strategy suggestions, experiences with these new regulations, or things you wish clients knew in this situation would really help me think through my next steps with my attorney.\n\nThank you.",

She can still request it and see if you get a sympathetic judge. She can also always request a continuance and see what happens.

Any time to allow USCIS to process the case without going to court is a win in my mind. \n\nrequesting OPLA not to oppose is not going to succeed, it is entirely up to the Judge.

It's a type of ethical question.\n\nI am American born and raised but I lived in another country for many years and learned their very unique language. My friends there were either American, Swedish, Canadian, and Australian.  United as foreigners there.  I never felt a citizen of that country. Big Whoop. They always called me a special name to denote my skin color too.\n\nIf someone from that country marries me, grew up w/tight knit family &amp; allegiance to that country by feeling of heart.  I guess it's natural to keep getting green card renewed and not do a type of pledge for a new country.  Why should that bother anyone?  It's just the way it is. Things change with the new generation, if they have kids and grow up here, they are American citizens.\n\nAs for someone who suggests keeping gc is bad because 'doesn't want to have responsibilities of a citizen'.  What responsibilities are you referring to?  As a citizen or gc holder there are no different responsibilities are there? Above a certain age there are no military obligations in the event of a draft. I can only understand that if you remain GC holder, you have \\*more\\* responsibilities because you must follow the law or get kicked out.  Citizens can't get kicked out for breaking the law.  \n\nFor the Danish guy, just remain strong.  Hardened.  Look at all the people suffering around the world and you are doing well in Colorado.  Just keep living your life and if anyone says anything tell them to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.  You'll be fine. I would go out of my way to buy Danish products too.  Why not.",

      "text": "We’re seeing a lot more people stuck in ICE detention lately, and it’s not random.\n\nAfter a recent BIA decision, the government is now treating many people who entered the U.S. without inspection as “arriving aliens.” That means ICE is classifiying these people under 8 U.S.C. § 1225 instead of § 1226.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nBecause under § 1225, ICE says the person is mandatorily detained and not eligible for a bond hearing. So even people with no criminal history, strong family ties, or pending asylum cases are being told they can’t get bond and end up sitting in ICE detention for months.\n\nRight now, one of the only ways to challenge this is through a federal habeas corpus lawsuit. A habeas lawsuit doesn’t argue the immigration case itself. What it does it challenges whether ICE is lawfully detaining the person. it is often successful and it can force ICE to treat the person under § 1226, which does allow a fair bond hearing.\n\nThis is why you’re seeing so many people detained with “no bond.” The situation has shifted, and it’s hitting families hard.\n\nIf a loved one is detained, it’s important to act quickly, because often ICE is transferring detainees to detention centers in Louisiana or Texas, where filing a habeas lawsuit can become much more difficult and less effective.\n\nHope this helps explain what’s going on.",

If anything it makes claims of _actual_ refugees much harder because now they face multi-year lines and extra scrutiny\n\nThe only let's say valid reasons to go to USA as opposed to staying in Mexico is if someone is fleeing drug cartels - but if we follow your logic we can have a guy who borrows money from a drug cartel and doesn't pay back - so now he's persecuted by the gang, flee the country, go to Mexico, ignore Mexico because obviously the gangs can find him there, cross to the USA, legally claim asylum because well, yeah he is persecuted by a criminal gang and then once he is settled in USA invite his entire family because now they have a family member in America which justifies them fleeing there and there in particular?

So the majority were indeed not valid even under the relatively loose criteria of the Biden administration. In addition, an asylum claim frequently comes about after other avenues are deemed invalid as a last ditch effort to stay in the country. So, it’s not that the individual is actually in fear from their country, but is likely an economic migrant who just wants to stay here.",

As OP stated, two parts of the law conflict. Historically mandatory detention has applied to border arrivals and people with criminal history, not everyone per se. There was a separate, bond eligible statue that DHS, DOJ, etc had used for literally 30+ years through D and R administrations for everyone else that allowed bond— now Trump is saying it doesn’t apply anymore. And 2) I think it’s quite unfair to retroactively apply a brand new standard to everyone that is already here. If this new legal interpretation is upheld by SCOTUS then it should be prospective to new entrants, not people who’ve been here for decades (imo).",

Further, law enforcement has always brought with it the risk of wrongful detention. If I match the description of a bank robber, I might be detained for that crime until we straighten it out etc.\n\nLaw enforcement needs clear, reasonable, articulable reasons to detain... they do not, in any way, need absolute proof of guilt.  In fact, since the trial often happens long after an arrest is made, it is very common that detention precedes the settlement of the legal question of guilt.\n\nAd in that the vast majority of those citizens being detained are likely those who were engaged in or reasonably suspected of being engaged in felony interference or assault on an agent? That is also far from random.",

They were brought to the U.S. as a minor but unfortunately do not qualify for DACA due to the year they arrived. This is someone who is incredibly kind, has no criminal history, and only knows the U.S. as their home.\n\nFrom what I assume is that ICE may have targeted their workplace due to suspected employment of undocumented workers. This individual does not fit the stereotypes people often associate with being undocumented—they speak perfect English, are well-educated, and you would never guess their status if you passed them on the street.\n\nI’m trying to understand two things:\n\n1. What are ICE detention facilities actually like?\n\nThis person is very book-smart but not “street smart,” which is part of why I’m worried. Are ICE detention facilities comparable to jail or prison in terms of how rough they are, or are they generally different in structure and environment? \n\n2. What options, if any, exist for someone in this situation? Specifically, someone who was brought here as a child, has lived most of their life in the U.S., but is fully undocumented and DACA-ineligible. Are there any forms of relief, humanitarian options, or legal pathways that are realistically worth exploring?",

They get two small bottles of water each day and extras cost $4 each. The commissary is very limited and very expensive. The workers make lots of noise at night that makes it very hard to sleep. There is extremely limited access to medical care - there was no doctor onsite despite the detainees having very serious medical problems. Overall, it sounded terrible.",

        "body": "Hello, I was an ICE Officer and have been in a number of detention facilities, with the last time being about 6 years ago. I believe ICE only has like 1 or 2 actually run by ICE. The rest are usually privately run facilities, or contracted with local jails. ICE has detention standards that must be met to house detainees in them that are generally stricter than what a detention facility requires to detain a U.S. citizen. That being said, I heard rumors they have limited the amount of jail inspections, and are lax on many of the standards in recent years. I know ICE had been pushing for compliance to standards adopted by all jails to detain U.S. citizens, and the extra ICE requirements were burdensome. That being said, they all have basic medical and will be taken to hospitals, etc., if determined to be necessary. Medical is not handled by ICE, but coordinated with the facility medical staff and US Public Health. Detainees can be housed alone, 2 man cells, or dorm like housing. It just depends on the facility. They are supposed to be segregated by criminal type. So you got like gang members, s#x offenders, very violent or problem people in segregation, to someone like your student who should be among the lower tier / low threat individuals. They have access to phones, and sometime tablets that help them communicate with the outside world. The facilities all require that they have free phone calls to their consulates. There are generally lists with each consulate, and a code they enter to direct dial the consular line. In short, they are jails, but they are pretty clean, they aren't dealing with crazies like most people who are arrested with such as if you or I got arrested for DUI, etc.\n\nAs far as what their chances to stay are like, I'm guessing your student already has a removal order. Many times the parents used children like Kryptonite to keep from being taken into custody. They are all issued documents for a later court date, and they never show for it and receive an in absentia removal order. This is definitely attorney grounds if they have any chance of reopening the case.\n\nI can say from direct experience, most ICE detainees are treated pretty good while detained. I have been in both local PD intakes and ICE processing, and ICE definitely treats you more like a regular person instead of an arrestee.",

They also do worksite enforcement where they request the business records for the people they employ. Then there are targeted enforcement when they are looking for specific people. This could be off of tips received at the ICE Tip Line or other info from Intel websites that collect all kinds of info on people. When encountering anyone, they can arrest anyone with them if they have no legal status. I'm not sure their current tools, but I heard they have some kind of facial ID tool, and we had a limited number of portable fingerprint readers before I retired about 6 years ago.",

        "body": "Hi,\nFrom my recent experience with someone who was detained by ICE with a pending asylum case this is what I can answer:\n\n1. The facilities can be heaven, depending on the state you are detained in. The original one my friend was detained in Bakers in Florida by Jacksonville was incredibly friendly in their treatment. He sign a paper waiving any rights, which I don’t recommend he sign anything until he knows what is involved, because ICE is not being fair if you let them take ownership of you. Once my friend signed, he hope to Lousiana, Mississippi,  and then Texas (Laredo), then given to the Mexican Authorities within a month and the Mexicans left him at Tapachula Mexico as a Venezuelan with no assistance.\n\n2. With no legal premise is difficult as people with a due process in immigration are being denied a process and kept enough time for them then get tire and ask for the volunteer deportation.\n\nIf there are ways to get legal help by you calling immigration advocate groups and getting him legal representation pro bono, I would highly star there, if he can wait time may be his friend. If he gets tired Voluntary Deportation needs to be ask and not to signed anything force by ICE. Also calls from most of this facilities cost around $10/ min\n\nHope this helps you help him in his path a better and brighter outcome.\n\nI wish him the best, as well as you!",

What facility?  \n\nSomeone needs to be locating them and talking to them by phone.  Also to send them some money so their detention is less miserable.  They will be able to make calls and receive mail also - or should be able to be.  \n\nDetention ranges from bad to awful without decent conditions.   \n\n&gt;Are ICE detention facilities comparable to jail or prison in terms of how rough they are   \n\nIt can be much worse than prison - although maybe less problems with other prisoners.  ICE should but often does not provide basic needs to detainees. It may be ok - but people have been held in bad conditions and this has caused suicides.  \n\nSecond priority for family or his support is to get a lawyer and see if it is possible for them to be released sooner and spend less time in detention.      \n\n&gt;What options, if any, exist for someone in this situation?   \n\nOnly a lawyer can tell you.   \n\nThe system has no kindness for someone in his situation - no one cares that the person was brought here as a child and knows no other home.

While the habeas is pending, they suddenly transfered him to an Oklahoma Ice facility. Not sure what will happen to the habeas case now that he was transferred. \n\nMore details on the Habeas case:\n\n\\- Filed late December \n\n\\- Judge ordered the respondent to provide their answer that shows cause why the petitioner's writ should not be granted by January 20\n\n\\- On January 16 at 4 am, they transfered the detainee to an Oklahoma facility.\n\n\\- Later that day, they filed their response with the court. Our attorney has until February 3 to respond. \n\nI don't know what their response was since I don't have access. But I am assuming they are claiming that the petitioner is no longer in their custody. \n\nWhat is the best thing to do with the habeas case now? Transfer it to the Oklahoma western district? Try to ask the judge to have him transferred back to Texas? Anything else that could be done?\n\nHoping someone can talk about their experience if it was similar, as I can't find much online. ",

        "body": "This is something that your attorney needs to handle either way, but the general rule is that habeas petitions are properly handled in the place where the detainee is located at the time the petition is filed. If your timeline is accurate, it seems like your attorney would continue the case in Texas and that the court in Texas would continue to have jurisdiction over his habeas petition, whether or not the judge orders ICE to physically move him back to Texas. I imagine they might not make that order if they are satisfied that ICE is not trying to dodge their jurisdiction (e.g. moved him to Oklahoma for more ordinary reasons) and will still cooperate with the judge's orders in his case.\n\nRegardless, discuss with your attorney and let them lead. I am not an attorney and this is not legal advice, but I have read lots of attorney blogs and judicial opinions discussing the question of the proper venue for habeas petitions for detainees being moved around by ICE.\n\nYou very likely can find the response yourself through [PACER](https://pacer.uscourts.gov/), but it might require making an account and/or paying some small amount of money to the system in connection with establishing your account. It's been a while since I've used PACER and am out of date on those specifics. Your attorney can probably also share the response with you.",

The attorney confirmed the master hearing  will continue as scheduled, however, the Oklahoma ice employees and other detainees are telling him the case will be transferred to Colorado. I'm not inclined to believe anyone but my attorney, but those people do have some inside knowledge of the inner workings of ICE plus personal experience from being detained there. Is there any truth to that? I can't find any information from detainees being held in the Diamondback Facility, since they just opened this month. And most of them are transferred from the Texas detention facility too.",

                "body": "No ICE employees or detainees get to decide on the transfer of the habeas case - only the federal judge currently handling that case, or a higher federal judge, can decide that. Again, the proper jurisdiction for habeas cases is generally the court with jurisdiction over the place where the detainee was physically located at the time the habeas petition was filed. There may be circumstances where that judge can or must agree to a transfer, I’m not sure, but it’s certainly not up to ICE or any other part of the federal executive branch.\n\nAs for the master hearing, the immigration court system is run by the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) within the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the executive branch. It’s quite likely that the rules for where those hearings should or may be held are different from those for habeas petitions, and I don’t know what they are. Any decision on a request to transfer the master hearing would depend on facts and circumstances of his case that the employees and detainees in the detention center likely do not know, and which may very well be different from the facts and circumstances in other cases which led to the outcome they’re predicting.\n\nBut even for any potential transfer of the master hearing, any involvement of ICE would be simply to ask the immigration judge to agree to a transfer of the case. The final decision is made by an immigration judge, who does work for the federal executive branch within EOIR and DOJ but who does not work for ICE or for any other component of DHS.",

Sure, ICE probably asked for that change, and then the immigration judge under EOIR agreed to the change and issued the necessary order. But that isn't the same as ICE having the power to transfer his case unilaterally - they don't. (And your attorney probably had the opportunity to oppose ICE's request to the immigration judge, but maybe there was no valid basis under EOIR's rules for your attorney to argue against the transfer.)\n\nPlus, any master hearing governed by EOIR processes is completely separate from a habeas petition in a regular federal district court, for which the general rule as to jurisdiction is still what I and other commenters have said. Moving his EOIR case to Colorado does not in any way predetermine what will happen to his habeas case. And as I said, the rules for transferring a master hearing are likely different from the habeas rules I outlined. Different court system, different laws, different procedures.\n\nGood luck to him in ensuring he gets all the rights he is due, regardless of jurisdiction.",

My impression is that the powers that be have deals with the private jail for-profit companies and that they want to prolong the detention process as long as possible. So what’s the worse case scenario and best case scenario for how long they would be detained? And how could they speed up the process if detained? ",

I’m not worried about myself, I’m worried about my father. He just recently became a US citizen last year, &amp; with all these ICE raids, I’m pretty worried something might happen to him. He looks &amp; acts very foreign, &amp; has a pretty noticeable accent. Again, not trying to make myself a victim, I just want to know. I am aware that ICE is targeting people of color (specifically Hispanics) but also they are targeting people who just seem foreign",

The u is a complete waste of money. There's at least a 20+ year backlog on u visas given the cap and until you get there, you aren't protected from deportation. \n\nThe odds of them giving you protection from deportation through VAWA after an agg felony drug conviction where you're seeking relief from federal prison are basically zero. \n\nYou're much, much, much better off saving the money for your family here, or to build a nice house in Mexico in the interim to await your return.",

She decided to take a trip back to her home country for about 3 weeks, worried if she will have any issues coming back, as all recent news of ICE seems to be about major rights violations and wrongful arrests. She has no criminal history and hasn’t violated any terms of her green card. Just really been racking my mind around this as recent news that my state will have an increase of ICE agents. Any advice would be helpful, thank you.  ",

Almost losing him made me realize how much I love him so after we said our goodbyes and he went too work. I began thinking that since I'm a veteran and a citizen I can marry him and he can get \"parole in place\" which means while waiting for the process of obtaining a green card he can stay here.\n\nIt came up in a conversation before and he says If someone wants to help me he will accept but he said if he gets caught its Gods will then. I know this won't be quick and will take a long time but at least we can begin the process and have a chance. living daily with this stress of I might lose him is horrifying.\n\nIs this decision to hasty?

Im in a long distance relationship with a US citizen. \nThe plan was always for us to get married, then ideally for me to go to America for a little bit as we finalize a move to europe. Mainly because of our pets, its a nightmare for him to bring his dog to NZ, but easy for me to stop in America on my way to europe with mine. \n\nNow things have changed and one, I dont want to take everything important to me including my pets to America, two I dont know if id get in because of my social media 🤣 \n\nBut I cant help feel scared he will lose the ability to come to NZ or europe with me. He can only come to those countries easily based on our relationship and my passports. If he is arrested randomly by ICE or if things go even more off the rails I could see him have criminal charges or a flag on his passport (he leans left and has gone to protests) and im assuming that our relationship wouldnt Trump a criminal record or flagged passport? (Yes we will get married before attempting to being him over or anything.\n\nGuess im jjst looking for advice or comfort that things will still be ok somehow",

      "text": "For context, I am in Dallas, Texas\n\nI didn’t know where else to ask, I don’t know who else to ask, but I’m terrified. I don’t even know where to start.\n\nI’m a US citizen, both my parents are US citizens. I am not at all worried for my sake, however, I did have a child with a Honduran immigrant, at the time we were married, he was a DACA recipient and is currently working his way to getting permanent citizenship. We were married and divorced. We have a pretty amicable coparenting situation now.\n\nICE is here. I haven’t seen them personally, but it won’t be long. For the last year I have tried to explain as best I can to my seven-year-old what is going on and what could possibly happen if his dad of grandmother were stopped by ICE (dad lives with his mom, she has a very significant role in helping raise our son, she is also working her way towards permanent citizenship).\n\nGiven recent events, I told my ex-husband that me, him, his mother and my fiancé need to all sit down and have a conversation about what’s going on in the world. Up until now, we have been vigilant, but not super panicked, as nothing had been really happening in Dallas, but like I said it’s only a matter of time.\n\nAll this context, just to say, I do not want to take my son away from his father at all, he goes over there every weekend, he hangs out with his aunts and uncles and cousins - a lot of of which are fully undocumented - but I would not know what to do if any of them were stopped by ICE and they had my son.\n\nICE are cruel and reactive, and I have rehearsed with my son what to say and what to do and I have told all the adults the same thing, to scream from the rooftop that he is a US citizen and that his mother is a US citizen, but I just don’t think that they would even care.\n\nThis reality seems even more plausible, considering my ex-husband was arrested a couple of years ago, no felonies nothing crazy, but arrested nonetheless. And I know that they are looking for any excuse to take people.\n\nWhat do I do? It is completely unfair for my ex ex-husband and his family to live in this fear and dehumanization, but as a mother, I just wanna keep my baby safe.",

See if your ex already has a lawyer.\n\nRole play with your son on how to remain calm and what he should do and say to any ICE officers whom he might encounter.  And you do the same.\n\nTalk to your son's father and his mom to see how they are preparing if ICE comes to their door or picks them up when they are running errands. Look for organizations that are having \"Know your rights\" seminars and have the family attend.  Immigration lawyers are recommending all green card holders keep their green card on them at all times.  If they have applied for citizenship and have receipt notices, have them keep these papers on them also.\n\nIt sucks that you and your family are facing this situation and I hope that you all never have to experience it.in anything except role play.",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m posting here because I feel completely lost and I don’t know where else to ask for advice.\n\nMy husband lived and worked legally in the United States for four years. He paid taxes, worked full time, and built a life here with me. We followed the rules and tried to do everything right.\n\nAbout a month ago, he was stopped on the road and taken into ICE custody. He is now detained at the Jena / LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. Since then, our lives have been turned upside down. I am now alone, trying to survive emotionally and financially while he sits in detention.\n\nHis family lives in another country and has refused to help. I have no financial support.\n\nWe spoke with an experienced immigration attorney who is willing to take his case, but the legal fee is far beyond what I can afford. I tried to get loans and credit, but I was denied because I already have existing debt.\n\nI’m terrified that without proper legal representation, my husband will lose his chance to stay in the U.S.\n\nIf anyone knows of nonprofit organizations, legal aid programs, or resources that help detained immigrants who can’t afford an attorney, I would be incredibly grateful for any guidance. Even just pointing me in the right direction would mean everything.\n\nThank you so much for reading.\n\nUPDATE 01/15/2026:\n\nHi everyone.\n\nSorry for being quiet for a while — I’m working from early morning until late at night and don’t always have time to check and respond.\n\nThank you all for the support and for taking the time to comment. I honestly didn’t expect such a big response. I’ll clarify a few things that keep coming up:\n\n1. My husband does not have any criminal record and did not break any laws. He was picked up during a confirmed statewide enforcement action. There were no criminal charges or violations involved.\n2. For safety reasons, I won’t be sharing detailed personal or case-specific information here. What I can say is that our entry and presence in the U.S. has been lawful, and we have documentation that allowed us to live and work here.\n3. We have been in the U.S. for almost five years, and we hold the same immigration status. I am able to work under this status, yet he is currently in detention.\n4. I am not asking Reddit to adjudicate our case or make legal conclusions. That is for immigration court and our attorney. My original question was about organizations that may help or ways to raise or borrow funds for legal representation. I am working two jobs, but it is still not enough, which is why I asked for resources.\n\nThank you again to everyone who shared information, resources, and words of support. I will go through all the comments when I get a chance. It truly helps not to feel alone in this.\n\nTo anyone else going through something similar — I’m so sorry. I know how emotionally and physically exhausting this is. I still hope things will get better for all of us.",

I can afford my life despite a mortgage at 6.5% interest and I am self sufficient - sometimes life throws situations at you that exceed your budget, which is when you look to programs, resources that can supplement. That’s why some lawyers do pro bono work. \n\nThe way you select language to imply this person doesn’t do enough and is not willing to invest is such a turn off.

        "body": "I’m so sorry - detention is financially and emotionally brutal, and you’re not alone in feeling stuck. A few steps that often help quickly in detained cases: Call local + national immigration nonprofits and specifically say: “Detained at Jena/LaSalle, Louisiana - need low-cost or pro bono counsel.” Many groups prioritize detention because timelines move fast. Ask the facility / ICE contact for the pro bono or low-cost attorney list for that detention center and whether there’s a Legal Orientation Program (some places have remote sessions). If you can’t get full representation, ask orgs about limited-scope help (bond hearing prep, filing a specific motion, or reviewing forms) - that can be much cheaper than full representation and still make a big difference. To make it easier for anyone to help you, put together a “case packet”: A-number, immigration history, any prior filings, criminal/traffic records (if any), marriage proof, taxes/employment, and all ICE paperwork. AI Lawyer is useful here as a support tool - it can help you build that packet, draft a clear summary, and generate a checklist of what nonprofits usually ask for, so you spend less time re-explaining everything and more time getting actual help. If you want, tell me what state you’re in (you, not him) and whether he’s had an immigration court hearing date yet - I can suggest which types of orgs are most likely to respond fastest for detention cases.",

Click around the Florence Project website under ‘Resources’. There are other organizations as well. Start reading as much as you can.

We are concerned with how long it’s currently taking for green cards and renewals and wondering if ICE will detain her if her green card expires before they approve the new one. USCIS has not been kind to anyone recently and appear to be assisting ICE in making more and more people “illegals”. Any thoughts or information? ",

      "text": "I’m looking for general information so I can be prepared and keep my family safe.\n\nA friend and her baby are temporarily staying with us. She is a long-term legal immigrant who has lived in the U.S. nearly her entire life, and her baby is a U.S. born citizen. She is currently in the middle of a divorce with ongoing court proceedings related to domestic violence. There is concern that her soon-to-be ex-husband may attempt to raise immigration issues as part of the divorce, even though she has documentation showing her lawful status. \n\nMy question is about my role as the homeowner.  If ICE were to come to my home asking to speak with her or requesting entry, what are my rights and obligations? Specifically, am I required to answer questions or confirm whether she is present? Is there anything I should or should not do as a host in that situation? I know that I do not have to allow entry without a warrant, but I don't know my rights beyond that.\n\n\nI am not trying to interfere with law enforcement or do anything unlawful — I just want to understand my rights and how to handle a situation calmly and legally if it ever occurred.\n\n\nI’m in Washington state, USA",

There are lawyers who would struggle with this out on the spot in an encounter with LE. \n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, not answering the door if ICE comes knocking is one way to try to achieve this goal, but if they do have a warrant you’re going to have kicked in door to deal with at the least. ",

If I am not the person being detained, do I still have the right to consult a lawyer first before answering anything? I am finding lots about the rights of the targeted person, but not on my rights as the \"landlord\".  Her address is legally changed to my house, I don't know if that changes anything either. \n\nICE was just seen 20 minutes from our home. She is not white and could easily become a target even without her ex. Again, I would love to ask elsewhere, but I don't know where to turn and the situation is feeling dire.

In one case it was a woman who had a removal order due to a denied asylum that is currently under appeal, so it is not yet final, but they still detained her. No other issues, no criminal history, nada. She did have her EAD and ID on her as required. The other is simply awaiting their defensive asylum hearing in front of the EOIR.

Does that means she deserves to die? Absolutely not.\n\nHowever, I compare it to incidents of road rage -- you are constitutionally allowed to hurl insults at other drivers. But just because some number of those road ragers get shot, doesn't mean I'm afraid to drive in the US thinking I'll lose my life.\n\nAs long as your wife isn't planning to antagonize ICE or refuse to show her green card when requested, she is virtually guaranted to be fine.",

Thus, the refugee definitions were written such that you don't need to be personally persecuted prior.\n\nIf South Africa started to throw white people in jail, you don't need to prove you've been personally thrown into jail, as long as people with similar characteristics as you are have been, to qualify for refugee status.\n\nUN can't do anything about it. It has no real army. Sanctions are useless since many countries don't uphold them. Russia is one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world and that hasn't changed their course for nearly 15 years.\n\nYou either wait for regime change, or intervene militarily like in Afghanistan/WW2, etc. Countries like US only intervene militarily when it fits their strategic interests (read: military position or oil). These interventions are also increasingly unpopular with the US voters. They don't seem to want to send their young men off to die for a foreign cause.\n\nMany countries like Somalia end up being left to do whatever it wants, because nobody cares enough to put money or lives on the line to fix it. Even if they do, failure rates are high. Plenty of persecuted minorities end up becoming refugees.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nMy wife is an asylum seeker in the United States. She entered the U.S. legally through the southern border and applied for asylum in 2024. Her immigration court case was denied in November 2025, but the decision was timely appealed and the case is currently pending on appeal.\n\nDespite the appeal, she has been detained by ICE in Nevada for more than four months.\n\nThe most serious issue is that my wife is currently pregnant (over five months).\nWhile in detention:\n\n• She has not received regular prenatal care\n• No ultrasounds, blood tests, or routine pregnancy monitoring have been provided\n• She suffered a miscarriage in June 2025, which makes this pregnancy medically high-risk\n• She has experienced weight loss during detention\n\nWe have repeatedly requested humanitarian release based on her pregnancy and medical risks, but we have not received any response.\n\nI am trying to understand:\n\t1.\tWhether holding a pregnant asylum seeker in ICE detention for a prolonged period without prenatal care raises legal issues\n\t2.\tWhether filing a Habeas Corpus case would be an appropriate option in this situation\n\t3.\tHow I can find a free or low-cost attorney or legal clinic willing to file a Habeas Corpus case, especially one involving detention conditions and medical neglect\n\nAny guidance or direction on where to seek this type of legal help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n",

There is decent and affordable OB/GYN care there.\n\nThere may be legal issues but a voluntary departure will be the fastest guaranteed way to get her out of detention.\n\nThe fact is if she entered illegally she will have to go back to Mexico to fix her status anyway. An overstay can be forgiven by marriage to a US citizen in adjustment of status but not an illegal entry.\n\nSo even if you were able to temporarily get her out while pregnant your problem would not be solved. If she leaves voluntarily (speaks to her ICE officer and asks to do so and signs the paperwork) she could apply for an extreme hardship waiver. such as if you brought the baby back to the US. Or wait out the reentry bar if that fails.\n\nOne other point that you should seriously think about. The *only* applicable grounds she would have to adjust status in the USA and gain legal status without leaving after illegal entry is to accuse you of domestic abuse. (VAWA) That would not be good for you or your family unity. Nor is her spending more of her pregnancy in ICE detention.",

Any recommendations, do we risk it and wait for 5 more months and file a habeas or just sign for self deportation? ",

      "text": "I’m an immigrant. I been out of a job for over a year. I been working under the table here and there to manage my daily life and to provide for my daughter back in my country. I met my husband 1 month prior to me getting laid off. I would go above and beyond for him, even after losing my job, I’d use  my credit cards just to get by and making sure he’s ok as well. Clothes, shoes, assistance with his credit card a few times so he could build his credit. When we met, I’d snuck him in my room whenever I could. I didn’t introduce to my siblings until a few weeks later. I finally introduced him, we became closer and always wanted to be around each other.Getting closer to him was when we became more and more transparent with each other about our situation. He would sleep at one of his mom’s house(in the backyard ,not in the house). I explained my expired visa situation to him. He offered to help and I said Yes.  I was really happy because I was really excited that I’d get to marry someone I love as well as obtaining my green card status. At the time I was still able to work registry as a caregiver because I still had my license. Before 6 months into the marriage everything was slowly going downhill. He couldn’t keep a job, he’d act weird at times (things that made me question his mental state, which I had asked him in the beginning,”how is your mental health?”, let’s just say he had given me the answer I’m looking for and not what I wanna hear. I did my own research and some of his behavior was related to bipolar,adult autism.I was still unsure. He’d be in his feelings for the simplest of reasons, he’d be petty, he’d tell me how much he loves and appreciates me but his actions were not the same. Not to brag but I’d do the things that is required of a wife or in a woman. I’d feel like his mom sometimes; constantly trying to keep him on track with his life. Before the 6th month of marriage, I told him we could file for annulment. He declined and wanted us to work things through because relationships are hard and we are newly married. He convinced me and I too wanted to work things through together because I know relationships are tough, especially marriages. I conditioned my mind that it wouldn’t be easy and that I shouldn’t look to run away from pressure. Jan 14th will be our 1 year anniversary and I can’t say I’m happy to celebrate it. I still love him. I still want the best for him. The question is.. do I continue to turn a blind eye and suffer for it. That’s what it feels like; like I’m suffering. I’m mentally and emotionally drained. My sister faked getting evicted so she could get rid of us which forced me to reach out to his mom and begged her to have us stay at one of her houses for 6 months and I’d manage the bills until I can get a job and get back on our feet. I did that for us. It was so much pressure to do it because he wouldn’t even try and talk to her. It’s like he knew that she would immediately shut it down because of how irresponsible he was in the past. I use to take care of his God’s mother’s mom and she’d pay me under the table; she transitioned November and now I have no form of income. He got back a job recently and so I’m hoping that he keeps it so these bills can be paid. For me, I feel like I’m stuck, not being able to provide for my daughter, not being able to pay my credit cards or contribute towards the bills. I’m basically dependent on him to eat food and nothing more. I wanna go home to my daughter. I wanna start over.  I messed up. Thank God I’m not homeless but I’m not far from it. His mom said it was temporary and this is our eighth month. I don’t know what’s worse…giving myself up to ICE or ride out the storm. ",

Also even if you divorce and find husband #2 who has no issues, this 1st marriage will count against you,  \n\nUnless you are happy to be limited to working cash jobs and spending at least the next 3 years being worried about being sent to an ICE detention centre, you should really think hard about returning.",

Things are moving VERY fast with the t visa so it is raising some flags for his lawyer and for us. He has been under order of removal since the 90’s and since his country of origin is Cuba we never really had to worry about him being deported since they don’t really take deportees. He has been going to every single one of his check ins. We recently found out they for some reason have no record of him checking in from 2019-2022. Should we be worried for him to show up to this appointment and has anyone heard of ICE using biometrics appointments as a way to get them in person to detain? My research says no since it’s a completely separate building from ICE but who knows what tactics they’re using nowadays. Just trying to hear from people so maybe I can ease everyone’s minds. He is in Las Vegas if that helps anyone give a better answer as well. ",

      "author": "Temporary-Act-7655",
      "subreddit": "immigration",
      "text": "First of all, apologies if this is not the right place to post this.   \n  \nMy fiance (immigrant) and I (US Citizen) have been together for a year and a half. We met via instagram and fell in love, since then we've had a great relationship. She has a passion for helping people (became a doctor in her home country, decided to come to the US for better opportunities in her field) shes goofy, intelligent, sensitive and incredibly thoughtful. I've never met someone who's treated me with the level of care and respect that she has, and she entered into my life right as I was giving up on dating. I'm truly blessed to have her in my life.  \n  \nI proposed to her about a month ago and (thankfully) she said yes. Mostly because I love her, but also because I want her to see her aging grandparents at home, I want to travel the country and world with her and I want to stop feeling this massive cloud of existential dread and stress that colors ever day of our lives.   \n  \nOur next steps are for me to finalize my taxes from 2025 so we can start the greencard process.\n\nShe came here legally in 2022 through a visa and ultimately decided to stay after the visa expired. Since Trump took office, we have just been living in absolute fear as I'm sure many American citizens and non-citizens are.   \n  \nThrough the machine of social media, both sides have been amplified for engagement. The worst of the worst seems right outside your door.\n\nWe often find our days hijacked by the instagram algorithm feeding one of us footage of ICE raids or Trump news, our moods completely ruined by it  resulting in us becoming hyper paranoid for the coming days/weeks. \n\nWhen we got our dog in the south, we white knuckled the entire 12 hour drive not stopping anywhere in the south just in case. We were meant to visit a friend in North Carolina, but bailed when we saw ICE activity starting  to happen in their subreddit. Despite that, she was nervous the entire drive down. We also skipped a wedding last year because one of the groomsmen worked for DHS and just the possibility that he and my fiance would happen to speak to each other was too scary. We told everyone that she was really sick with the flu.  \n  \nJust a couple hours ago I came downstairs to find my fiance in tears on the couch. She'd been doom scrolling through ICE videos and was extremely scared. Not only that, but there was a completely unexpected raid a couple towns over from us with ICE agents allegedly staying in a hotel for the next week or so.\n\nWhat I'm trying to gauge is a threat level here, so I can determine a plan of action. It's the difference between taking full responsibility of everything outside the house (not letting her work/ walk the dog/ go to the gym/store etc.) or just continue living our lives albeit being very cautious until we can enter the greencard process. It's the uncertainty that gives us the most amount of fear.   \n  \nThe separation would be devastating and ultimately the relationship would be over as she would be barred from entering the US for at least 10 years if deported. Trying to shoulder all of our commitments and responsibilities on my own would be next to impossible, I would absolutely need to move out of my apartment sell my car and give up our dog. I'd likely lose clients or my business would go under as I'd be unable to meet the mental demands of my work. Then theres the lack of empathy from friends/ people in general, the amount of people who would applaud her removal, just based on the reductive fact that \"illegal is illegal\" breaks my heart and ingites an alarming rage within me. Finally of course, there are the stories of alleged sexual assault and torture happening to these immigrants that are circling would put me in a mental state that frankly, I'm scared of what it would entice me to do. \n\nICE is like an Eclipse from Berzerk level threat to me, and I'm grateful I'm at least able to make that tongue in cheek comparison without it being a reality.  \n  \nFrom what I understand, once we are in the green card process my fiance has a \"legal leg\" to stand on were she detained by ICE. I guess I'm more worried about her being actively tracked and them coming to our home. The good news is she works with a family in a private home not far from us and the only other place she goes is to the gym/grocery store in a relatively all in a relatively \"White\" neighborhood (which sounds horrible to say.  \n  \nOur town is small and relatively quiet with quiet neighborhood streets and no city center and a highway running through it. She has no criminal record, came to the US legally, has a social security number, pays her taxes. We don't tell anyone her status, the only people who know are immediate family and they're just as worried, so I don't want to spread the word to our friends and potentially compromise her.\n\n Is it possible my fiance could be targeted and tracked?\n\nApologies for the rant, not going to do a TLDR bc I feel like the context/stakes are important to get quality feedback.\n\nThank you.",

        "body": "I think you're missing the bigger picture here trying to solve your \"fiance's\" problems. You've only known her for a year and a half and met her online when she was already out of status. That's an extremely high risk relationship scenario. The odds of her stabbing you in the back the as soon as the ink is dry on her green card (or filing papers if she's impatient, or naturalization papers if she's extra patient) are extremely high.\n\nNow let's assume she's genuinely in love with you \\*and\\* has no ulterior motives \\*and\\* your international, cross-cultural rushed marriage doesn't fail for all the other reasons it could. Now what?\n\nWell, a valid visa overstay can often (usually?) be forgiven with a US citizen spouse petitioning for status. If you have all your ducks in a row. There have been some high profile cases of spouses still being taken in at USCIS appointments when they are overstays, which didn't happen before, and some of them had to file for habeas and get bailed out and then ultimately got their petitions approved. I don't think that's necessarily still likely but no one can say.\n\nMeanwhile you need to do your taxes and you'd have to get married and actually file the petitions to give her any kind of status to hang onto. Until you do that, could ICE pick her up? Well, it depends on if they encounter her or are looking for her. It's a matter of both hunting and fishing. The other thing is are you positive she doesn't have any secrets hidden from you that would cause complications with either marrying her or immigrating. You didn't say how much time you've spent together in person, just that you met her online a year and a half ago.\n\nI gotta say you should pretty much discount almost the entire online relationship as far as knowing her for marriage purposes.",

        "body": "If she's illegally in the US, the law allows her to be deported and ICE will do it. It does not matter that she's paying taxes or has no criminal record - those are not requirements for deportation.\n\nICE detention facilities are of course vulnerable to the same problems in jails and prisons across the US - inmate-on-inmate violence / sexual assaults do occur. ICE often uses the same facilities and contractors as state/local jails. Given that prison guards in state jails and prisons have committed violence against inmates in the past, it is inevitable that the number of such occurrences in ICE facilities is not zero. However, there is no evidence to suggest such incidents are more common in ICE detention facilities compared to non-ICE facilities.\n\nFiance (as a relationship) has no legal protection for her if she's detained by ICE. A marriage is the only thing that offers protection, so you need to get married ASAP if you're serious about this relationship. \n\nBecause she's unlawfully present in the US, she could be detained by ICE until the marriage green card (adjustment of status) is approved. While this is rare, it does happen - so you need to be prepared for this possibility. Filing for the green card requires her to show up to biometrics and an interview, both of which are opportunities for ICE to arrest and/or detain her until the adjustment is approved.",

        "body": "A few thoughts to add: 1) Without telling you what to do with your life, there's a lot to be said for getting married ASAP, including that if your fiancee were to get caught by ICE before you're married, it's going to be logistically harder to marry, plus the legal standards by which an immigration judge in deportation proceedings would assess whether your marriage is bona fide (the real thing) get raised; that is, the judge will be seriously dubious; 2) Since she's out of status now, switching to most other immigration statuses (i.e. tourist) will be impossible, but the combo of marriage to a U.S. citizen and legal entry to the U.S. should allow her to use the 'adjustment of status' procedure to apply for a green card without leaving the United States. Once that process is underway you're safer, but the sad truth is that ICE sometimes arrests people at what's supposed to be the final stage in the process, namely at the adjustment of status interviews (see this news report, for instance: [https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2025/11/25/ice-agents-arrest-green-card-applicants-in-san-diego](https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2025/11/25/ice-agents-arrest-green-card-applicants-in-san-diego); 3) To move the process quickly, you'll probably want to file the I-130, I-485, and other forms and documents concurrently, instead of filing the I-130 first and waiting for a reply, especially given the possibility that listing her U.S. address on the I-130 could trigger enforcement efforts by itself, and 4) This is a case where a lawyer's help could make a difference; someone to help you weigh the risks in light of the latest legal developments and make sure your paperwork is prepared perfectly, with no errors that might cause delays. They usually charge a flat fee for this type of service, making it easy to price compare.",

        "body": "Interior deportations (what could affect your GF) were barely up in 2025. Your GF should be maybe 20% more worried about ICE swooping her up this year than last. \n\nThe administration knows it really can’t affect the huge numbers of illegals here. They can only deport like 500k tops and there are 15m here, and millions can easily come per year. The strategy is to scare people into not coming (which has worked, border encounters have crashed) and to self deport (which has also worked, self deportations are 4x forced deportations). \n\nFor your gf, if all she has done is overstay and you guys get married, there is very little to worry about. ",

Public employees, even the former ones, do enjoy extended privacy protection, greater than the general public, but the job status isn't one of them. As Open Record/FOIA goes, things that are not specifically restricted are supposed to be open to the public; that's the *raison d'etre* of Open Record/FOIA/government transparency.\n\nIt's more like the flight trackers or, more commonly, Waze or Google Map feature listing where police is located. There's no absolutely no identifying information on that feature as well. Police did try to shut that down by claiming that the information poses risk to the officers but was not successful.\n\nThis is however different in one key aspect. The previous case touched on the First Amendment because the government was trying to enact a prior restraint on the protected speech. The Hilton case is not that, but as far as sensitive or personal information, it's no different from the hotel posting that they have a lot of guest attending a local convention or concert.\n\nIt was simply Hilton/Towne Park pandering to their big contract, which they can, but given the current situation, pretty deplorable.",

I’m looking to hear from anyone who has personal experience or direct knowledge of this.\n\nMy family member is currently in ICE detention and was the victim of a serious crime while detained. We are trying to understand whether a U visa is a realistic option in situations like this and what that process actually looked like for people who went through it.\n\nSpecifically, I’m hoping to learn:\n\t•\tWhat type of crime occurred (at a high level, no details needed)\n\t•\tWhether the crime happened while in detention or custody\n\t•\tIf law enforcement or another agency was willing to sign the required certification\n\t•\tWhether detention or removal proceedings were paused or affected\n\t•\tAny major obstacles or lessons learned\n\nI understand this is very case-specific and I’m not asking for legal advice, just real-world experiences. Even hearing that it didn’t work out would still be helpful.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone willing to share. This is overwhelming to navigate and firsthand insight would mean a lot.",

In practice, it is easier for authorities to distinguish legal immigrants/ non-immigrant foreigners from illegal immigrants. It is a lot harder to distinguish illegal immigrants from CITIZENS. Legal immigrants and non-immigrants have a clear trail of papers that prove their status, and are legally required to carry them. Citizens, on the other hand, usually don't have enough papers to prove that they are citizens. Natural-born ones are at a disadvantage compared to naturalized ones here.",

      "text": "I believe the United States should enforce its borders and maintain an orderly immigration system. A country that cannot control who enters is not fully sovereign laws, planning, and safety matter. Coming here illegally cannot simply be ignored, because selective enforcement undermines the law, hurts citizens, legal immigrants, and even the migrants themselves.\nAt the same time, enforcement must be accountable. ICE agents should wear body cameras, display visible identification, and operate under strict oversight, except in cases where exposing them would put them or their families at risk, such as operations against cartels, gangs, or smuggling networks. Psychological screening, thorough vetting including social media and past behavior and longer training are essential. Anyone given authority over another person’s life should meet higher standards than average government employees.\nI draw a clear line between criminals and noncriminals. Someone living quietly, working, paying rent, and raising children should not be treated the same as someone committing violence or trafficking drugs. Deportation for non-criminals should be carried out humanely, with proper legal documentation, court hearings, and due process.\nEnforcement and empathy are not mutually exclusive. A nation can protect its sovereignty, uphold the law, and still preserve human dignity. History shows that order and legitimacy endure when authority is exercised with fairness and accountability. Extremes on either side chaos or cruelty erode society. The goal is the hard middle: a system that commands respect because it is both lawful and humane.",

So, how do you deal when you have one side that doesn't want them to leave and the other side that says deport them. How would you like immigration to handle when people hide and resist when they have a deportation order???  Just ignore them and deport nobody???  I think most countries would arrest you and deport you.  As far as ICE covering their face, I don't blame them when people threaten them and their families at home.",

It is instead the number of \"suspected\" in-country overstays, defined by the number of people for which the US has an entry record but couldn't find a matching later exit record. This could be because of an actual in-country overstay or it could be because of imperfect record keeping.\n\nA reason to think that imperfect record keeping might be a significant part of that comes from the Canada land border where exit records are obtained from Canada sharing their entry records. The most recent overstay report says that about 2% of those exit records, or maybe 900k or so (including US citizens) in a year, couldn't be matched to a corresponding US entry record. If the error rate for entry-exit record matching in the database as a whole is anything like 2% that might explain much of the 500k. number.",

For example, the Netherlands lets you sponsor your (unmarried) partner on your visa as long as you have evidence it's a real relationship (joint lease, joint bank account etc.). Spain has a similar process if you live together for 1 year (pareja de hecho). I'm a US citizen and we ruled out the US early on because it's impossible for us to move there without getting married, and a huge pain (1+ year waiting time) if we do get married.\n\nIt's a myth that the US is easy to immigrate to - it's one of the easiest countries to settle and integrate into local culture (like my parents did when they entered the country through chain migration) but it's one of the hardest to actually legally immigrate to. There's no digital nomad visa, no working holiday visa, no unmarried partner visa etc. You would think the US would want someone like me and my partner (who is from one of the countries with an even stronger passport than the US) living in the US, paying our taxes to the US etc. instead of the situation we find ourselves in now - living abroad and having all of our income excluded from US income taxes because the US doesn't offer us a visa pathway.",

No written confirmation was provided.\n\n\nHe currently has a pending asylum case with USCIS. His asylum case was previously in immigration court but was dismissed because he had valid TPS at the time. After TPS was canceled, he filed for asylum again with USCIS in November 2025.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nHas anyone had a recent ICE check-in where they were told they no longer need to report?\n\n\nDid you receive any written confirmation, or was it also verbal?\n\n\nThanks in advance for any shared experiences.",

My lawyer gave me a  copy of the immigration court decision affirming the dismissal of the case.If he has filed an asylum with USCIS it is highly recommended for him to have a lawyer and a back up plan.

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m trying to get some clarity and see if anyone else has experienced something like this, or if this may just be confusion.\n\nMy uncle is currently in ICE detention and has **already surpassed 90 days** in custody. He previously had an interview with ICE related to possible release under Alternatives to Detention (ankle monitor).\n\nAfter being moved back into general population, other detainees told him that since he already had this interview, his family could supposedly contact the ankle monitor company directly and that the company could “go get him” from detention. My uncle does not speak English, so he struggled to explain the name of the company, but it sounded like something like “Libre” or “Nexus.”\n\nFrom what I’ve been able to find online, it seems that ICE must approve release first and make the referral, and that families cannot independently contact a monitoring company to trigger release. At this point, we have **not received any official confirmation from ICE**, no Order of Supervision, and no contact from any monitoring company.\n\nI’m trying to understand:\n\n* Has anyone else heard of a company being able to release someone directly from ICE detention?\n* Is this a common misunderstanding among detainees?\n* For those who passed 90 days, what did the process look like after the ICE interview?\n* Is there anything families can realistically do at this stage besides waiting for ICE to decide?\n\nI’m not looking for legal advice, just real experiences so I can understand whether this is legitimate or simply misinformation being passed around inside detention.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

If so, did that affect whether you were released?\n* Were you able to choose which country you departed to?\n\nI paid my husbands $500 voluntary departure bond.

Our loved one was in our regional jail in WV from 1/15-2/5.. locator site showed 2/5 evening that he was at a facility in GA.. 45 minutes later it said Port Isabel, TX. 2/6 he was told he was going to Alexandria LA with no further information and he got there last night. Locator site now says “call ICE for details” even though they won’t give any details.\n\n\\*\\* I’m aware of the new law for 5th circuit court that took effect on 2/6.\n\nUPDATE\n\nHe was just told that he is getting on a plane at 4am to go to Georgia.",

I’m especially anxious given the current immigration situation under Trump’s admin and the recent ICE actions on the news. \n\nlive in LA, and I am Korean. I was once **denied entry** years ago at Abu Dhabi pre-clearance, but was admitted the second time with updated documents. \n\n(I was on F-1, I had an EAD,  and a job offer but my school program had ended and I was in a limbo status. CBP wanted more documentation about my new job)\n\nThis was in 2019 and since then I have been able to re-enter the country successfully 5+ times. The first 2-3 times, they asked alot of questions, once or twice taken to secondary, but then after that there were no issues. ",

Fix your country. \n\nI would never flee my country. I would push for positive change even at the cost of my own life.

The Guatemalan government is now accepted as having been guilty of committing genocide against indigenous Guatemalans. They killed over 200,000 over a period of 36 years. Entire villages were wiped out. The Salvadoran government was brutally repressive, and tortured and killed 10s of thousands of its people. One such punishment was hanging a political dissident by their fingers and then jamming a wooden rod up their ass.\n\nMany of the people who fled had been fighting. Many were victims of torture. Many were the only surviving members of their families. \n\nIn those years the US rejected 99% of asylum applications from Guatemala and El Salvador. Accepting them would have undermined the billions of dollars in military aid that the US was sending to those countries that funded the slaughter of their citizens. The Guatemalan military dictatorship, for example, rose to power after the US funded and led a coup against Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. Arbenz was overwhelmingly elected in 1950 with 65% of the vote in an 11 person election. As Preaident, Arbenz was guilty of instituting land reform. Wealthy landowners with uncultivated land were compensated at fair market value for their unused land, and that land was redistributed to 500,000 landless peasants, many of them indigenous. The largest landowner in Guatemala at the time was the United Fruit Company, a massive US multinational corporation with strong ties to the government. \n\nThe phenomenon didn't end. In 2017, Keldy Mabel Gonzáles Brebe de Zúniga fled Honduras after members of MS-13 murdered most of her family and threatened to kill her and her children. MS-13 was of course started in the US and was exported to El Salvador because of the mass deportation policies of the 80s. When she arrived to the border after riding through Mexico on top of a train, a journey that many don't survive, she claimed asylum with her children. She was separated from them, detained for 18 months, and then deported.\n\nI understand that this is not every migrant's story. But it is the story of many. \n\nYou, who will hopefully never be persecuted like that, who will hopefully never even come close to witnessing the horrors of genocide, torture and mass murder, who will never know desperation like that, to feel like staying in your home country, which you may still love for all of the reasons people love their home, will result in certain death...you comfortably sit behind your phone and dismiss those who flee violence on a scale you will never know as \"lacking integrity and strong character\". It is \"stomach turning\" to you.",

Honestly you only know about the US which was literally the foundation of democracy. You don’t know how other countries operate, or if the system even allows for anything like your paragraphs. Hell, many countries wouldn’t even exist with colonialism, and were haphazardly put together without involvement of the inhabitants. They literally joined warring tribes then told them to fix their country after they fucked it up. You can’t even begin to understand how complex other countries are.\n\nHonestly, withhold judgement till you have all the facts including their lived experience. Also, by your definition, most of the US population/ ancestors were weak-willed opportunists. Also perhaps, you may feel like dying, but would you tell these “weak-willed opportunists” to let their kids die, their family members die? Have all the facts first. You don’t want the weak willed, but you just want those looking for higher salaries,  or who just like New York? I don’t think any reason for migrating is better than any other. This is about legal immigration in general\n\nEdit: also the 2A is there in case the gov turns on its citizens. Most countries’ citizens don’t have that and are defenseless when shit hits the fan. Also obviously my entire defense is for LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.",

When you have millions of immigrants in the nation without a good legal way to get citizenship that doesn’t take decades and all of these people have children as well, how do you suppose all these people kids shouldn’t become citizens when they grow up here. Considering majority of African Americans are descendants of slaves who were all enfranchised and became citizens in one go and the 14th amendment was designed to fix that problem. Considering that all of your recent European immigrants like Italians and Poles and German for example came over in the last 120 years and then their kids become US citizens. There are so many problems if you get rid of birthright for anyone who haven’t been in the US for multi gen that it’s dumb to discuss this. For the record, child of legal immigrants, I can here legally as well, my siblings are born here citizens, I was naturalized. Taking away birthright is basically telling me that my siblings lives don’t matter though they grew up here and nowhere else. And in my medical career you must be a legal permanent resident or citizen. Do you understand how long it took to get a green card? My entire teenage life, I know people who came here legally, grew up here, who still are on a visa and cannot go to med school like they dreamed. American dream motherfucker",

The real problem is that immigration is vital for the US to function so when Trump declares that he's going to ramp up a deportation effort, it must be done in the correct way in order to not fuck up the entire country economy. Targeting unauthorized immigrants with violent criminal records was a platform that Trump paraded and still parades. The numbers and evidence of DHS' ineffectiveness prove that Trump is directing deportations in not only the most inhumane way possible, but also the literally dumbest way in world history.\n\nIf you or anyone *actually* thinks we have an over-immigration problem then the only policy that works is getting rid of violent criminals first, then exercising due process for the rest while subsidizing the industries that are impacted and most importantly, giving out criminal charges for anyone who knowingly employs illegal immigrants. Trump would never do this because his platform is built on hate and building privatized death camps makes him richer.",

                            "body": "&gt; forcing future admins to at the very LEAST secure the border\n\nEven the current administration doesn't seem interested in securing the border. Congress was poised to pass a secure the border bill as part of one of the previous shutdown fights last year, and Trump ordered his Republican congressional colleagues to kill it.\n\n&gt;  Put an end to this political football of immigration\n\nNo significant number of politicians in either party want to do that. On the Republican side specifically, that would lose a major get-out-the-vote issue for the anti-immigration part of their base, and too many Republicans and Democrats know that large parts of the US economy depend on illegal immigrant labor who accept pay and working conditions that legally present people unafraid to exercise their rights would never tolerate. \n\nThe easiest way to fix illegal immigration is not to deport the people who will either sneak right back or be replaced by the next batch of illegal immigrants, it's to stop the reason they're coming in the first place: the employers. The jobs are here, and not on appealing terms to people with full rights, so the illegal migrants take them.\n\nHow do you do this? Make E-Verify mandatory for everyone performing services in the US for a business, whether as an independent contractor or as a leased/subcontracted or directly hired employee. Make it a strict liability criminal offense for any business to have someone performing services for them in the US without having first opened an E-Verify case for the worker, or after any tentative nonconfirmation fails to get resolved and becomes final, or without being able to provide I-9 and E-Verify information to DHS in a timely manner upon audit. Ramp up audits of the employers, but also check business and personal banking records vs payroll provider and direct deposit records vs Forms W-2 and 1099-NEC vs E-Verify to catch things proactively. Make the violation as severe as if the employer were running a meth lab: seize the business as part of the penalty. Transfer operation to a for-profit subsidiary of a government-chartered nonprofit focused on helping workers whose employers have abused their rights. And run an ad campaign about all of this in Spanish and other origin-country languages, both in the US and in the origin countries.\n\nAbsolutely that would stop people coming illegally in anywhere near as large numbers as they do now, since it removes the reason they come. So that's the best way to solve illegal immigration.\n\nBut that would also put a lot of restaurants, cleaning services, construction crews, hospitality businesses, and the like out of business, because - as I said - too much of the economy depends on illegal immigration unwilling or unable to protect their rights to good pay and working conditions. (Some also depends on prison labor that's either forced labor or paid pennies per hour which would be illegal in any other context, which is part of why the war on drugs exists and is enforced in a racist way. Slavery had to be replaced somehow when it was mostly abolished.)\n\nOf course, in theory the economy could adjust not to depend on an abused and undercompensated underclass like I just described. But this would require either that the owner class reduce their level of profits or that the general public pay more. The owner class currently has too much political power to accept that, and the general public has both too low wages of their own to pay more and too much job-dependence to protest (not to mention too much anti-union indoctrination to take collective action like a strike).\n\nThe problem is hard to fix, but even harder than you think, and far more bipartisan.",

Unless you see some evidence of me having a set of talking points to push more than just \"I'm making an argument you disagree with in response to something I felt you implied but didn't outright say\", please give me the same courtesy.

In immigration law, it's absolutely irrelevant whether the crime committed is violent. It's equally (un)important as providing statistics on how many detained people know how to swim.\n2. There is a lot of non-violent crimes that are a safety threat to the communities (drug dealing, burglary, minor porn distribution…).\n3. If a person with a removal order is caught in the act of committing a crime, they don't have a criminal record, but they are deportable.\n4. Even if, for the sake of argument, we accept the game CBS is playing and focus on violent crimes, the data shows *exactly opposite* to what the activists/journalists are trying to say. People convicted for violent crimes in the general population are probably less than 3%. Getting 14% among illegal aliens is proof that ICE actions are highly targeted and efficient.",

                            "body": "Here are the actual facts: Trump is the one who has pushed for and achieved partial government ownership of companies like Intel and US Steel and generally tried to centrally influence private companies’ business decisions. Mamdani has made exactly zero proposals to transfer any ownership of private businesses to the government he now runs. He has also met with business and landlord groups in NYC, heard their concerns without ordering them around, and made clear he wants them to continue to succeed even if he is also paying more attention to worker and tenant concerns than many past mayors. When Trump holds such meetings with a business or a top executive, it’s usually coupled with threats during or after the meeting unless the company or executive praises or enriches him or his family or makes the business decisions he desires.\n\nAs for DSA and socialism overall, the first NYC mayor to be openly affiliated with DSA during his campaign, David Dinkins, certainly didn’t push any of the agendas you just listed; nor did the second one to have had some history with them, Bill de Blasio, or the first NYC mayor who at some point in his career once openly affiliated with the Socialist Party, the very highly regarded Fiorello LaGuardia. (LaGuardia accepted the Socialist Party endorsement in his 1924 congressional campaign and then used their label in Congress.) The many European political parties with words like Socialist in their name are similarly within the democratic political mainstream and aren’t generally trying to take over private industry.\n\nI wouldn’t call either Trump or Mamdani communist overall for a variety of reasons, nor DSA as an organization or democratic socialism as an idea, but Trump is closer to it than Mamdani or DSA or democratic socialism.",

Plus there is at least one current member of Congress with a DSA affiliation and at least one current member of the Senate self-describing as a democratic socialist, None of these have been communist.\n\n&gt; His religion also allows him to lie if it serves islam so I dont put much stock in his integrity.\n\nWhoever shared that claim with you was repeating an Islamophobic myth. Islam generally forbids lying, and the Islamophobic myth is based on expanding the scope of the few exceptions well beyond what's actually specified by Islam. Every religion and every secular moral code typically allows lies in some cases; for example, Jews in the Inquisition or the Holocaust who publicly renounced Judaism but continued to practice in secret, an employee who lies when her boss asks her if she's pregnant because she doesn't want to face illegal pregnancy discrimination, a spouse who lies about what's in a box because they don't want to spoil the surprise of their anniversary gift, a military official or diplomat who lies because they don't want to blow an intelligence asset's cover or disrupt an important operation, etc.\n\nNothing about Islam would give Mamdani any excuse to lie to the public about whether he's communist or not, and certainly nothing about Islam would do that for the many non-Muslim of DSA.\n\n&gt; We will have to see I guess, I sincerely hope I am wrong.\n\nWe agree that we both hope we don't have a dishonest and covertly communist NYC mayor, yes. I'm not going to pretend Mamdani is necessarily fully honest any more than any other politician, but he at the very least seems to be within the political norm in that regard, and probably within the better part of that political norm.",

If you get married before he's deported and file the I-130 petition, you might be able to apply for a hardship waiver (I-601A) that could reduce or eliminate that bar. The key is showing extreme hardship to you as the US citizen spouse if you had to wait the full 10 years or relocate to Guatemala\n\n  \nI went through something similar with my cousin's situation a few years back and the immigration lawyer we worked with was able to get the waiver approved based on medical and financial hardship factors. It's definitely not guaranteed and the process is still long and expensive but it beats waiting a full decade. You really need to get a good immigration attorney ASAP though because timing is everything with these cases and there are specific steps that need to happen in the right order",

If that’s the case, he doesn’t need a waiver, just a petition and the wait time will be the normal processing time (still likely to be a few years, unfortunately)\n\nIf he does have a permanent bar, it’s 10 years before he can even apply for a waiver.\n\nIf he has a 10 year bar (filed asylum late or worked without waiting for the EAD), how long it will take to get him back depends on if the waiver is approved and that’s definitely something you want an attorney for.",

I speak English fluently. I may have a slight accent at times. I am Hispanic, but I do look a little Asian. \n\nShould I hold off on this idea?",

Using ICE as a threat is a common tactic in domestic or toxic dynamics to maintain control, but it doesn't make the anxiety any less real. Since you're 18, you have the right to choose where you live, but it’s understandable why you’re hesitant if it puts him at risk.

      "text": "I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this and this will be long so please don’t comment that it was too long, just move along if you’re not interested. 🙂\n\nI (32F US citizen) met this guy (29M immigrant) 5 months ago on a dating app. He lives a state over, just over the line (it’s about an hour and a half from me). Anyway, we chatted for a few days and then decided we would talk on the phone. He was very easy to talk to, the conversation was great, and it wasn’t awkward. \n\nAnyway, here’s the complicated part: he doesn’t leave his house because he claims that he is nervous about ICE. For context, we do not live in an area where that is super prevalent. I do try to understand and put myself in his position, but it’s really starting to bother me. I really do like him and I enjoy spending time with him. We talk all the time (which is easy to do bc he doesn’t have a traditional job).. but that bothers me also. \n\nI don’t want to end things just because things aren’t ideal right now, but tbh he’s pretty vague about his immigration status. Anytime I bring it up he says that he has to wait for the to contact him to schedule some interview? Idk. Does that even sound right? I honestly don’t care if he is here legally (he says he is), but I do care about how my life will look in 5-10 years (if we end up making it that long). \n\nAnyway, lately I have just been sad that we don’t have a regular normal life where we can go out for dates and stuff. All my friends are in relationships and it’s hard to still kinda feel single bc my boyfriend isn’t willing to (and I swear I’m saying that with kindness) leave his house. \n\nHas anyone else been through this? I have looked at it from a few different angles:\n\n\\#1 I would not date someone who is on house arrest. I know this is a different situation completely, but the fact that he “can’t” leave is a major problem for me. I also would not date someone who is unemployed under normal circumstances. \n\n\\#2 Maybe I should just be patient because I have no idea what it’s like to immigrate to a new country or deal with the current climate with all the crazy ICE stuff. \n\n\\#3 I wonder if the roles were reversed, would he be willing to go through this for me. \n\nI know I rambled a lot in my post. I just have a lot on my mind and I’m writing this at work, so I’ve had to write it a little at a time. I do apologize though. \n\nI’m happy to clarify anything. If you have questions, just ask. I’m really struggling with how to proceed. ",

Bondi, No. 26-CV-603.pdf - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnY2z7eb5efGlHrb2AYBtfqMVDJSUfIu/view)\n\nIt was a hearing to determine why ICE is not complying with his orders to release those in detention who are being held without legal basis.  In the hearing, Judge Blackwell makes this statement:\n\n&gt;That authority under Article III only has meaning if the court orders are obeyed, adhered to promptly, fully, and in good faith. That obligation matters most where liberty is at stake. Detention without lawful authority is not just a technical defect, it is a constitutional injury that unfairly falls on the heads of those who have done nothing wrong to justify it. The individuals affected are people. ***The overwhelming majority of the hundreds seen by this Court have been found to be lawfully present as of now in the country***. They live in their communities. Some are separated from their families.\n\nThis site states that 97% of habeas petitions for immigration cases in 2025 were granted in favor of the detainee.

      "text": "I have a close family member who was issued an I-551 in the early 1980's, when they didn't have an expiration date. At some point in the past 10 years, between having her house demolished in a hurricane and moving across the country, it was lost. She's asking me if she should file for a replacement so she has it if/when confronted by ICE or if ICE will just grab her during the appointment. I have no clue how common this situation is so I thought I'd turn to Reddit and ask if anyone has personally experienced a run in during the replacement process (i.e., replacement, not renewal). Thanks in advance.",

We are filing for cancelation of removal, but I'm worried it will not be approved due to the current guidance that immigration judges have right now. \n\nHe entered without inspection around 30 years ago, and I know right now they are denying immigrants bond due to illegal entry. \n\nHowever, he has:\n\n\\- pending VAWA petition\n\n\\- no criminal record\n\n\\- strong ties to the U.S.\n\n\\- citizen children under 21\n\n\\- is the main provider of his household. \n\n\\- his petition has given him prima Facie and an EAD\n\n\\- he has good moral character\n\n\\- has filed taxes all those years he's lived in the U.S.\n\n\\- no previous deportation orders\n\n\\- never left the U.S.\n\nThe only negative is the initial illegal entry. \n\nHas anyone here recently been through immigration court or know someone who has, and was granted the cancelation of removal? In similar circumstances? It will help my brain analyze the situation. \n\nAlso, his judge is very strict. His asylum denial rate is 86.1%, if that's any indication of his stance on immigration cases. \n\nHe has an active Habeas Corpus case in Texas but it will likely be denied because of the new ruling in the Fifth Circuit.
