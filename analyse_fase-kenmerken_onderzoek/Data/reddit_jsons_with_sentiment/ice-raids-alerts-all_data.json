      "text": "Patriot Cosplay Isn’t Courage\n\nI’ve watched Jake Lang try to rebrand himself as a political prisoner and a folk hero, but the record tells a far less flattering story. Lang became one of the loudest self-promoters to emerge from the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, using the chaos of that day as a launchpad for notoriety, fundraising, and personal myth-making. While others faded into obscurity or took responsibility, Lang leaned into grievance politics, turning criminal charges into content and consequences into clout.\n\nWhat’s often missing from Lang’s self-serving narrative is accountability. By 2023–2024, federal juries had little patience for the cosplay-patriot routine, finding him guilty on multiple serious charges related to the attack. Rather than reflecting, Lang doubled down—portraying judges, jurors, and even fellow defendants as enemies in a sprawling conspiracy against him. The pattern is familiar: deny, deflect, monetize. Every court loss became another excuse to solicit donations and attention, all while claiming persecution instead of acknowledging the harm done to democratic institutions and public safety.\n\nBy early 2026, Jake Lang’s legacy isn’t one of bravery or principle; it’s a cautionary tale about what happens when ego and extremism collide. Dressing up recklessness as resistance doesn’t make it noble, and shouting “freedom” doesn’t erase the facts. History is unlikely to remember Lang as a martyr. More likely, he’ll be remembered as someone who mistook noise for leadership—and paid the price for it.\n\nGC",

They have different titles. \nSecond,  if the protests were actually peaceful, there would be no issues. \nThe \"protestors\" are mostly paid. And, they're available to protest any day or time because they don't have jobs or are entitled by their rich parents. The \"illegals\" are not just from Mexico. They're from Iran, Syria, China, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, and many other countries. Our country is a melting pot of nationalities, as it should be. However, our ancestors had to get their citizenship the right way. \nAlso, Democrats didn't have a problem with deportation when Obama and Clinton deported millions. If Democrats are so in favor of letting illegal immigrants stay here, why aren't they inviting them into their homes to live with them? If every Democrat invited the single male, or family that is here illegally to live in their home, we wouldn't need to deport them. That's because you would be giving them shelter and food, and they wouldn't be getting free assistance that is intended for Americans down on their luck. You would also be accepting of any violence and drugs they bring with them. \nSo, before you try to get people killed(ICE agents) with \"Peaceful Protests\", why don't you think about that? Why are the protesters showing up with weapons? THAT'S NOT PEACEFUL. \n Those agents are doing their job. They have families, too.",

And that she was at the front, leading the protest by blocking the streets and letting the cars go one at a time. I’m not here to talk about her, but when that happened, she said that the police have become lackadaisical and have basically enabled the protesters do what they want and call it peaceful protesting.

I’m finding everything on them rounding up people who originally applied for citizenship, and didn’t follow through like they were supposed to. I am finding they’re rounding up people whose citizenship needed to be reestablished and wasn’t. \n\nHouston  ICE does *not* have the authority to deport or detain American citizens and they haven’t as far as I can find. \n\n*However* \n\nIsolated Incidents &amp; Mistakes: Reports indicate that in rare, past instances across the country, U.S. citizens have been wrongly detained or, in very limited cases, deported due to database errors or misidentification. \n\nThis is not Houston. \n\nHowever what did happen in Houston that I found was one man was illegally detained by them for 40 days being suspected he was undocumented. \n\nThat is one account. \n\nSo it seems like they’re doing more of what they’re supposed to do, instead of what is being propagated. \n\nThis is an open dialogue. My views won’t change regardless but I love to see what others see and think about what’s happening here~",

They’re in bed with them. They get paid to turn their heads. \n\nIf we’re expanding this to our government in general, they’ve been committing fraud for years. Helloooooooo Hillary Clinton~ \n\nIf we’re limiting this to illegal immigrants, they’ve been doing illegal shit since the dawn of time. It is only NOW these things are being highlighted. \n\nBut to not understand THAT? To think it’s just racist and targeting and profiling. To think it’s just one group doing something illegal. \n\nThats ignorant. \n\nThis shit has always been happening. Somalian fraud in Minnesota for the last 13 years for example. \n\nPeople have BEEN coming to the US and illegally doing shit to get money. It isn’t new. \n\nPeople have been crossing borders illegally. Nothing new. \n\nThe point of my comments, is just to ask why is everyone suddenly wanting to act like ICE stepping in openly, is a sudden issue. \n\nThey’ve always been doing this.\n\nThe issue yall have with them doing their jobs all of a sudden. \n\nIt’s giving bandwagon.

People are also a lot less likely to question regular patrol cars making random traffic stops and it's usually too late by the time anyone notices that it's a Hispanic family being stopped, and that another unmarked car just rolled up behind the cop.\n\nLocal media also does their share, not really covering stories of ICE activity and even actively burying the stories.

      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "US Mid-Terms and Ballots Under ICE Watch: My Fear of a Silent Siege on Democracy\n\nI am writing this as a citizen watching a neighbour unravel, close enough to feel the heat, far enough to speak without a badge at my door. Based on what I have seen , I believe the next U.S. midterms risk becoming less an election than a test of nerves. Not through laws passed in daylight, but through presence. Through uniforms. Through the quiet, calibrated fear that keeps people at home.\n\nI believe ICE will be positioned around polling places in targeted communities, not everywhere, not loudly, but strategically. The message would not need to be spoken. For voters racialized as “other,” including citizens, the question will be simple and paralyzing: do I vote and risk being stopped, questioned, delayed, denied? Or do I stay home and keep my family safe? Thousands of darker-skinned citizens and non-citizens alike have already learned what denial feels like, at borders, checkpoints, courthouses, workplaces. Memory does the rest. Fear travels faster than policy.\n\nThis is not about enforcing immigration law on Election Day in any formal sense. It is about the optics of enforcement, the theatre of authority placed where it does not belong. A uniform near a ballot box changes the cost of participation. It weaponizes ambiguity. If you have ever watched a line thin out when police arrive, you know how power operates without touching anyone.\n\nI imagine how this could go down. Early voting sites see “security coordination.” Rumours spread on encrypted chats and local radio. A few documented stops, a few viral clips, a few denials that sound plausible enough to pass the nightly news. Officials insist nothing is happening. Technically, they may be right. Functionally, turnout drops where it matters most. Suppression without fingerprints.\n\nThis is how an asymmetrical civil war advances, not with barricades but with thresholds. One side votes freely. The other calculates risk. Institutions remain intact while legitimacy drains away. The battlefield is procedural, the casualties invisible, the victory claimed by margins that look lawful on paper.\n\nI do not write this lightly. I write it because democracies rarely fall in a single blow. They are managed downward, one frightened choice at a time, until silence feels safer than participation. When the right to vote becomes a test of courage based on race, the war has already begun, and it is being fought where we were told we were safest: at the polls.\n\nGC",

I’m fed up and concern for my own life if I get pulled over for not looking “American” enough despite I served for this country.\n\nI don’t trust Trump. I don’t doubt he’ll find a way to denaturalize our citizenship if he’s allowed to just because I’m not white.",

      "text": "Red Hat Rage at a School Walkout\n\nWhat should have been a peaceful student walkout in Hays Consolidated ISD, Texas, turned ugly this week when an adult man wearing a red MAGA hat drove into a crowd of students and began assaulting them. The students were participating in a non-violent protest over ICE enforcement and immigration policy when the confrontation erupted.\n\nVideo shared widely online shows the adult leaning out of his vehicle and striking at students gathered around the car. The students, many of them minors, appear unarmed and non-aggressive, chanting and filming as part of the walkout. Witnesses on the scene identified the man as an adult MAGA supporter who became enraged by the protest.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage across social media, with many questioning how a grown man felt emboldened to use physical force against students exercising their right to peaceful protest. Parents and community members are now demanding accountability and clearer protections for students engaging in civic action.\n\nOnce again, a protest about ICE ended not in dialogue, but in violence directed at kids — a stark reminder of how quickly political anger can spill over when intimidation replaces debate.\n\nGC",

An unplanned escalation of events is not going to be recorded prior to it happening.  \n\nI personally do not care what “started” it.  One grown man (clearly shown) tackling one female minor is the only information I need.  People need to quit saying that it was self-defense.  \n\nYou can clearly see him lunging at one female student.

First they came for immigrants and refugees. Then Muslims and people of colour. Then journalists, teachers, and students who protested. Then union members, whistleblowers, and anyone who organized. Then LGBTQ+ communities. Then lawyers and judges who stood in the way.\n\nEach step was justified as law and order, security, or necessity. Each time, many believed it would stop there.\n\nWhat is happening in the United States now makes that saying urgent again. The list is expanding, not shrinking. The targets change, but the pattern does not. Rights are removed one group at a time, while others are told to stay quiet and be grateful it is not them.\n\nThe lesson has never changed. When people wait their turn to speak, the list keeps growing.\n\nGC",

      "text": "Death Cards on the Wind\n\nI never thought I would write this, but here we are. Across the United States citizens are reporting that ICE agents are leaving behind so called death cards after enforcement actions. Playing cards linked to killing and intimidation, left in vehicles after people are taken away. Not a warrant. Not a notice. A message.\n\nFor working people who live paycheque to paycheque, this is not law enforcement. It is fear dressed up as authority. Blue collar families know what intimidation looks like. We see it when bosses threaten layoffs. We see it when corporations squeeze wages. Now we are seeing it from the federal government.\n\nThis is happening while deaths connected to ICE and other border agencies continue to rise, while families wait for answers that never come, and while politicians argue on television as if it is all abstract. It is not abstract to the people who come home to an empty driveway or a silent phone.\n\nIf an agency can terrorize immigrants today with symbols of death, it can terrorize workers tomorrow. History shows this never stops at one group. This is no longer just about borders or paperwork.\n\nIt is about power, and who they think is allowed to feel safe in their own neighbourhood.\n\nGC",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.'\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\"How?\" might you ask, are you to abolish this tyrannical government? Well, here's another reminder:\n\n\n---\n\n\nUS Constitution 2nd Amendment: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a FREE STATE, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nOrganize. Build a community. Form a local Militia, call it a fucking neighborhood watch if it makes you feel better. Get off social media, let go of this culture war bullshit. Maybe have another read of these little refreshers. Exercise your second amendment rights. If you don't, it'll only be a matter of time before ICE puts one of these cards in _your_ vehicle for your family to find.",

Here are just some of the Nazi slogans and propaganda posted by DHS and ICE.\n\nBased on reports in early 2026, several posts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and affiliated agencies like the Department of Labor have been criticized by experts for utilizing phrases and imagery that mirror Nazi propaganda, white nationalist literature, and neo-Nazi anthems. ®\nBelow are the specific slogans and phrases highlighted in these reports:\n• \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage\"\nPosted by the Department of Labor in January 2026, this phrase was flagged for its strong similarity to the Nazi slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\" (One People, One Realm, One Leader).\n• \"We'll have our home again\"\nUsed in a January 2026 DHS/ICE recruitment post, this phrase is the title and lyrics of a song associated with a U.S. fraternal neo-Nazi group.\n• \"Which way, American man?\"\nPosted by DHS in August 2025 on X (formerly\nTwitter), this was identified as a reference to the 1978 white supremacist book Which Way, Western Man?.\n• \"A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth\nDefending\"",

        "body": "Look, when you’re a U.S. Senator, you don’t get to act like a commentator. You’re responsible for the stability of the system itself.\n\nThat’s the core issue here.\n\nWhat went wrong wasn’t calling for accountability. If an ICE agent left a card like that in a vehicle, it’s unprofessional and should be addressed through discipline or corrective action. That point is straightforward, widely agreed upon, and not controversial.\n\nWhat went wrong is how Senator Hickenlooper handled the situation before the facts were established, and why that matters at a national level.\n\nAt the time of his public statements, several critical facts were unresolved. It had not been conclusively established who placed the cards. It had not been established whether ICE agents were responsible. Motive had not been determined. ICE leadership had already condemned the conduct and launched an investigation.\n\nDespite that, Senator Hickenlooper publicly characterized the incident using charged moral and ideological language, linking it to intimidation, racism, and historical symbolism. That framing moved well beyond “this needs investigation” and into implied conclusion.\n\nFor a senator, that distinction is not academic. It is fundamental.\n\nWhen a U.S. senator assigns motive and meaning before an investigation concludes, they are no longer simply overseeing the system. They are shaping the outcome of public belief in advance of evidence. In today’s political environment, that carries real risk.\n\nThis is where the governance failure lies.\n\nSenior elected officials don’t just communicate information. They anchor narratives. Once a narrative is anchored by someone at that level, it is extraordinarily difficult to undo, even if later facts complicate or contradict it. Corrections never travel as far or as fast as accusations, and senators know this.\n\nThe danger isn’t hypothetical. It undermines public trust in investigative processes. It pressures agencies and inspectors to conform to an implied conclusion. It escalates hostility toward frontline personnel before wrongdoing is proven. It further erodes institutional legitimacy in an already polarized system.\n\nEven if misconduct ultimately is confirmed, preemptive moral certainty damages the integrity of accountability itself. Due process is not strengthened by foregone conclusions. It is weakened by them.\n\nA responsible approach would have required discipline, not silence.\n\nThe appropriate response from a senator responsible for national governance would have been to clearly acknowledge the seriousness of the reports, state that if verified the conduct would be unacceptable, publicly recognize that ICE had already condemned the behavior and opened an investigation, explicitly separate concern from conclusion, and avoid assigning ideological or symbolic meaning until facts were established.\n\nThat is not weakness. That is leadership.\n\nWhat happened instead reflects a broader and worrying trend. Elected officials increasingly speak as if their primary role is moral signaling rather than institutional stewardship. That may be politically effective in the short term, but it is corrosive in the long term, especially when public trust in law enforcement, oversight, and government legitimacy is already strained.\n\nThe higher the office, the greater the obligation to restraint.\n\nSenators are not activists. They are not pundits. They are custodians of systems that must function even when emotions run high and facts are incomplete. Acting otherwise may feel righteous, but it increases instability and reduces the credibility of legitimate oversight.\n\nThis criticism isn’t about intent or partisanship. It’s about judgment.\n\nFor the good of the nation, leaders at that level must model procedural seriousness, especially when allegations are disturbing and politically charged. Accountability should follow evidence, not precede it. Anything else risks trading momentary political advantage for long term institutional damage.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "The Deportation Machine Comes to Springfield\n\nBy GC\n\nFederal immigration enforcement in the United States is expanding again and this time the focus is not the southern border but the heart of the country. In Springfield Ohio a growing Haitian community is bracing for intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity following months of political scapegoating and renewed policy direction tied directly to Donald Trump’s return to power.\n\nHaitian migrants in Springfield have already endured a year of online misinformation viral conspiracy claims and open political hostility. Those narratives have now translated into enforcement. ICE operations are being scaled up in interior cities and Springfield has become a test case. Advocates on the ground report increased federal presence data collection and quiet coordination with local agencies. Families with Temporary Protected Status and mixed status households are preparing for raids detentions and removals.\n\nThis expansion is not happening in a vacuum. It is being powered by technology and by private companies that profit every time enforcement grows. At the centre of that system is Palantir Technologies the data analytics firm co founded by billionaire Peter Thiel and run by chief executive Alex Karp. Palantir software is now deeply embedded inside ICE operations nationwide. Its platforms integrate federal databases track individuals map networks and prioritise targets. ICE officials have described the system as providing real time operational visibility from identification to arrest to deportation.\n\nPalantir’s contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE are worth tens of millions of dollars and continue to expand. These are taxpayer funded agreements awarded under claims of urgency and national security. As enforcement widens Palantir’s revenues rise. Peter Thiel remains a major shareholder. Alex Karp continues to publicly defend the company’s work as essential to state power. The result is a private firm quietly shaping how immigration enforcement functions across the country.\n\nPalantir is not alone. Amazon through Amazon Web Services provides the cloud infrastructure that stores and processes ICE data. Microsoft supplies software and cloud services that support federal enforcement systems. Defence and surveillance contractors continue to benefit from biometric tools data storage and analytics used in immigration control. Each arrest each raid and each deportation is supported by a paid digital ecosystem funded by the public and operated for profit.\n\nDonald Trump’s role in this expansion is direct. His rhetoric during the 2024 campaign and after returning to office framed Haitian migrants as threats and burdens despite repeated debunking of those claims by local officials and journalists. That language created political cover for enforcement escalation. What follows now is policy made operational with algorithms databases and contracts.\n\nIn Springfield the consequences are human. Churches and mutual aid groups are preparing emergency plans. Parents are afraid to send children to school. Workers are avoiding hospitals and public offices. A community that was recruited to fill labour shortages is now being treated as disposable.\n\nThis is how modern deportation works. It is quiet. It is technical. It is profitable. And it is expanding.\n\n\\#DeportationIndustry",

      "text": "Children Caught in ICE Enforcement\n\nIn recent months ICE has faced growing criticism over how its operations affect children. Reports from across the United States describe children being detained during immigration raids and family enforcement actions, sometimes held for days or weeks before courts intervened. Judges have ordered the release of young children after finding their detention unnecessary and harmful.\n\nCommunity accounts and video evidence have also shown tear gas and pepper spray used during enforcement actions and related protests where families and children were present. While officials often say children are not the intended targets, the reality on the ground has been that minors have been exposed to chemical agents during these operations.\n\nThese incidents have intensified public outrage and renewed calls for limits on enforcement tactics, stronger protections for children, and an end to practices that place minors in the middle of aggressive immigration policing.\n\nGC",

Obama's DHS/ICE also wasn't dealing with a record increase in illegal aliens like we are now so very different circumstances in every way.\n\nHere's a fun fact you clearly don't fucking know. **It was Obama's expansion of expedited removal that started deportations without due process**. Look it up. Obama also went after entire families and denied them due process. These are all facts. They prioritized speed over fairness and they did it in WAY BIGGER NUMBERS. So yea, idk wtf you're talking about but just because the media wasn't up Obama's ass to where you could see every mistake they committed doesn't mean they didn't commit far more and worse things than what the current admin is doing.\n\nHow about the videos of Pretti from a prior protest kicking a fucking tail light in on a fed car? That's peaceful too right?\n\nAre innocent people getting caught up, yes, for sure. Regardless of the party never underestimate the federal government's ability to fuck something up. However, statistics and history are simply that and if you're pissed at the current state you have to be pissed at the prior admin as well as the Obama admin for literally paving the road for this.\n\n[https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/speed-over-fairness-deportation-under-obama](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/speed-over-fairness-deportation-under-obama)\n\n\"Yesterday the Migration Policy Institute (\"MPI\") released the report, [*The Deportation Dilemma: Reconciling Tough and Humane Enforcement*](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/deportation-dilemma-reconciling-tough-humane-enforcement), on the Obama administration's immigration enforcement record. One of MPI's principal findings is that the deportation system has dramatically changed over the past 19 years – moving from a judicial system prior to 1996, where the vast majority of people facing deportation had immigration court hearings, to a system today of nonjudicial removals, where 75 percent of people removed do not see a judge before being expelled from the U.S.\"\n\n\"The numbers are staggering: in 1995, 1,400 immigrants were subject to nonjudicial removals, representing 3 percent of total deportations. By FY 2012 that number had sharply increased to 313,000 nonjudicial removals – an all-time high.\"",

To say all protests are riots is not true. To say you lose all your rights if you make mistakes is sad. \n\nGood police work include to separate the rioters. You need tactics, knowledge and training for doing so. The key is to deescalate. \n\nThe right to protest should be secure by the LEOs and not sabotaged. That is the case in a democracy. Saying you shouldn't protest because people/LEOs will escalate it and it's your fault if you get between is the pre stage of losing democracy. \n\nPolice forces are responsible for a certain outcome. They should be trained and specialized. Mass and Riot control is a highly specialized unit most police forces around the world.\n\nAn army of 3000 DHS officers doing everything that they feel too is not constitutional, and that is the problem. \n\nAnd arguing like you the next point you could say is: if you are pregnant, don't go on the streets, if you are old, don't go on the streets, if you are peaceful, don't go on the streets. \n\nIt's a shame to blame peaceful protesters and to say they shouldn't be there in first place. It's always the same for certain people like you: just don't be there and all is good. \n\nThe truth is that a lot of people just live there, where should they be? In their homes waiting until DHS come to their homes and get you hurt there? \n\nThe idea of federal law enforcement is good. Especially when they trained for what they doing and just doing especially what they trained for. Riot control shouldn't be part of ICE and co. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are riots, that's what they show on TV but most of the protests are peaceful, but these pictures aren't interesting for TV. It's more impressive to see people moving a container. But you forget the pictures of ICE deploying teargas without warnings. The protesters were without masks in the first days. \nHave you ever thought about it why the hell ICE is equipped with teargas in first place?",

      "text": "THEY’RE MAKING MONEY OFF FEAR IN AMERICA \n\nI want to say this plain, because working people deserve plain truth.\n\nThis isn’t about left or right. It’s about power and money.\n\nThere are billionaires who don’t need to wear badges or run agencies. They build the systems behind the scenes. Peter Thiel is one of them. His company, Palantir, sells data tools to the government. ICE uses those tools to track, target, and detain people. One side shows up at the door. The other side gets paid quietly.\n\nHere’s the part that matters to you!\n\n1. The more fear there is, the more money they make.\n\n2. The more people they can track, the bigger the contracts get.\n\n3. The more chaos on TV, the easier it is to sell “security.”\n\nThis machine doesn’t care who you voted for. It doesn’t care if you’re a citizen or not. Once a system is built to watch, sort, and punish, it always looks for new targets. Today it’s migrants. Tomorrow it’s protesters. Next time it’s workers who organize, speak out, or refuse to stay quiet.\n\nThat’s how oligarchy works. A few people at the top control the tools. Everyone else lives under them.\n\nThis is what fascism looks like in real life. Not boots marching in the streets, but spreadsheets, algorithms, and contracts. Control wrapped in corporate language. Profit made off fear and division.\n\nIf this keeps going, it won’t end in a clean fight. It will be messy and uneven. Working people pushed until some snap. Communities turned against each other while the people at the top stay protected and paid.\n\nThat’s why workers have to resist now, together, and smart. Not with chaos, but with solidarity. Talk to each other. Organize. Support unions. Protect journalists. Demand transparency. Refuse to let fear turn neighbour against neighbour.\n\nThey want you scared, divided, and silent.\n\nThe one thing they can’t profit from is a working class that stands together and says no.\n\n\\\\#WorkingClassVsOligarchs \n\nGC",

      "text": "ICE Next Door\n\nBy the start of 2026, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is no longer operating only in marked vehicles or behind federal office doors. It is increasingly blending into everyday communities, deliberately minimizing its visibility while expanding its reach. Agents now conduct operations in unmarked cars, wear plain clothes or generic tactical gear, and coordinate quietly with local databases and private contractors. The goal is simple: move without drawing attention and act before anyone realizes what is happening.\n\nThis shift has real consequences on the ground. People no longer know whether the individual questioning a neighbour, watching a workplace, or filming a protest is a federal agent, a private security contractor, or just another civilian. That uncertainty chills daily life. Parents hesitate at school drop offs, workers fear job sites, and bystanders second guess whether recording an arrest will make them a target.\n\nICE leadership has framed this approach as officer safety and operational efficiency. Critics see something else entirely: a federal police force dissolving the line between civilian space and enforcement, while reducing accountability. When agents are indistinguishable from the public, it becomes harder to identify authority, harder to demand warrants, and harder to hold anyone responsible when things go wrong.\n\nBlending in may make arrests quieter, but it makes democracy louder with anxiety. Communities function on trust and transparency. When enforcement hides in plain sight, that trust erodes, and fear fills the gap.",

        "body": "They’re using “gray man” tactics. Appearing Unremarkable: The core principle is to avoid drawing attention. This means adopting a neutral appearance that matches the local population and culture, avoiding overt tactical gear, logos, or colors that scream \"prepared\" or \"military\".\nCamouflage through Population Density: Dense urban areas inherently provide cover and concealment due to large populations, which make it difficult to distinguish combatants from non-combatants. Militants often operate from within neighborhoods and homes, intertwining their military activity with civilian life to complicate identification and targeting.\nIntelligence and Local Knowledge: Blending in effectively relies on deep local knowledge of the area, including street layouts, building interiors, and even subterranean networks (sewers, subways). This allows forces to move undetected, set up ambushes, and disappear before the enemy can react.\nHit-and-Run Strikes and Ambushes: Instead of pitched battles, forces that blend in use hit-and-run tactics and ambushes. They strike quickly and then melt back into the civilian population, exploiting the dense terrain for escape routes.\nConcealment of Assets: Weapons, armor, and communication equipment are kept concealed or disguised. This can extend to modifying vehicles to look normal, even with added improvised armor, to avoid aerial detection or suspicion.\nSocial Simulation and Situational Awareness: This involves more than just physical appearance; it requires an understanding of local social dynamics and maintaining ordinary body language to seem like a typical civilian.\nLeveraging Civilian Infrastructure: Combatants might use neutral sites like government buildings, banks, or churches that are structurally strong or which friendly forces might be reluctant to attack due to policy restrictions or the risk of collateral damage. \nThese tactics are a significant challenge for conventional militaries because they negate technological advantages and require extensive intelligence capabilities to separate combatants from the innocent population. \nThe City Is Not Neutral: Why Urban Warfare Is So Hard\nMar 4, 2020 — While urban insurgency campaigns can involve pitched battles against massed insurgent forces, more frequently insurgents attempt to blend in with local populati...\n\nModern War Institute -\n\nGray",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "A Canadian Billionaire’s Warehouse and the Quiet Expansion of ICE\n\nBy GC\n\nA warehouse in Hanover County Virginia does not sound like the front line of immigration policy, but that is exactly what it has become. The property is owned by Jim Pattison Developments, part of the Jim Pattison Group, a Vancouver based conglomerate controlled by one of Canada’s wealthiest businessmen. That warehouse is now slated for purchase by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and conversion into a processing facility that could function as an immigration detention site.\n\nInmight add that there is currently no operating detention centre and no final sale, but the intent is clear. ICE has formally notified local authorities that it wants the property and wants it for immigration enforcement. That alone places a Canadian owned asset squarely inside the machinery of America’s deportation and detention system.\n\nThis is not about a single building or a single transaction. It is about how global capital quietly intersects with the enforcement state. A logistics style warehouse near a major highway is not an accident of geography. These are the kinds of sites that allow for rapid intake, holding and transfer of people with minimal public visibility. When these facilities appear, they are almost always described as administrative or processing centres, even though their function on the ground often looks and feels like detention.\n\nThe Jim Pattison Group is no fringe operator. It is a sprawling empire with interests in real estate, food, media, transportation and industrial development. The company is deeply embedded in Canadian economic life and largely invisible to the average person going about their day. That is what makes this moment uncomfortable. A Canadian owned development is positioned to become part of an ICE expansion at a time when immigration enforcement in the United States is growing more aggressive, more secretive and more politically charged.\n\nThere is also the question of distance and accountability. Decisions made in corporate boardrooms thousands of kilometres away can have direct consequences for migrants and families on the ground in the United States. Local communities are left reacting after the fact, while ownership structures and development arms provide layers of separation from the human outcomes.\n\nNo one is alleging that Jim Pattison personally designed an ICE detention strategy. But ownership matters. So does profit. When public outrage focuses only on government agencies, it lets the private infrastructure that enables those agencies fade into the background. Detention does not happen in a vacuum. It happens in buildings, on land, through contracts, sales and investments.\n\nThis proposed facility has not opened its doors yet. There is still time for scrutiny, public pressure and accountability. Canadians like to believe our wealth and corporations exist apart from the harsher edges of American policy. This warehouse in Virginia suggests otherwise.",

      "text": "America Is Breaking and People Are Dying\n\nBy GC \n\nI need to say this plainly, because dressing it up helps no one. People are dying in the United States because the system is coming apart. Not overseas. Not in some future nightmare. Right now.\n\nMen and women have died in ICE custody. Some died in detention. Others were killed during enforcement actions that were supposed to be about immigration but turned into deadly encounters. In Minneapolis, another protester was shot dead during ICE related operations. That city is now carrying bodies, grief and rage all at once.\n\nJust yesterday, Minneapolis also saw the biggest general strike it has ever had. Workers shut the city down. Not because they wanted attention, but because they feel trapped. When working people stop showing up, it means they believe the rules no longer protect them. That is not activism. That is a warning flare.\n\nHere is what scares me most. The talk has changed. Regular people are openly discussing armed resistance. Not just online weirdos. Community groups, including Black Panther aligned organisations, are talking again about defending their neighbourhoods with force if needed. At the same time, right wing militias and left wing armed groups are training, recruiting and preparing. These groups do not trust the government. Many do not trust each other. All of them believe violence is coming.\n\nPolice are caught in the middle. In many cities, local police and state authorities are refusing to work with ICE. Federal agents show up anyway. That means you now have armed groups with badges pulling in different directions. History shows this is how countries slide into civil war. Not all at once. Piece by piece.\n\nLet me put the worst case in simple terms. Cities split into zones. Federal agents holding certain areas. Local police standing down or pushing back. Neighbourhoods forming their own armed patrols. Supply chains breaking. Food, fuel and medicine becoming harder to move. Retaliation after retaliation. No clear battlefield, just chaos that never fully stops. That is what an asymmetrical civil war looks like. It is messy, slow and brutal, and regular people pay the price.\n\nFrom Canada, we are watching closely. Our government and military are preparing for things that would have sounded crazy not long ago. Plans are being made for large numbers of Americans crossing the border to escape violence or collapse. At the same time, Canada is strengthening its defences to protect its sovereignty if instability spills north. This is not about attacking Americans. It is about preparing for reality.\n\nI write this with regret. I warned before that America was heading down this road. I wanted to be wrong. I did not want to see workers shot in the streets, families broken apart or cities grinding to a halt. But here we are.\n\nTo American workers, know this. People outside your country see what is happening. We know most of you just want to work, raise your kids and live in peace. But the system you are trapped in is cracking fast. Without serious change, restraint and accountability, this does not end with speeches or elections. It ends with neighbours facing neighbours, and a country learning too late that violence is easy to start and almost impossible to stop.",

Maybe even, we want you to retaliate if you are challenged, provoke things and make someone do something stupid so you can claim you had some justification. These ICE agents though don't seem to need to be told twice about what they can and can't do, and there are probably very few restrictions. \n\nAlready the arrest, detention and disappearance of people is happening and is being normalised. The cruelty and the arbitrariness of it is not accidental, it's deliberate. Even and especially when it involves children. Is that how societies are supposed to operate? Maybe in tin-pot dictatorships but in a country that believes and was founded on principles of freedom? \n\nThe ICE agent who murdered Renee Good is still a free man, you'll note there was no condemnation or apology from Trump, instead he doubled down on the rhetoric as he will do here, that is if he hasn't done so already. \n\nTrump is allowing these people to live out their fantasies and they are taking full advantage, but he's a symptom of the problem as much as a cause. Look for those that are funding and organising this - blaming immigration or criminals is always a good lowest common denominator for these people. It always has got the useful idiots agitated. \n\nThings may get worse and these no doubt are testing times, they'll test your belief in the system and the moral fibre of those elected to Congress, national and state level. The lack of fight-back from Republicans in Congress is what should really frighten you, either they are cowards unwilling to say speak truth to power or they are directly complicit. Their silence should speak volumes.",

I have several firearms, go to the range regularly, and have even taught some amateur classes to my community members about firearm safety. I frequented gun subs, do some light gunsmithing, and was the guy everyone in the group could count on to know what weapon an actor was using in the movies.\n\nI might not be the most radical 2A advocate (I do believe in common sense gun laws), but I do believe that people should be taking their concealed firearms to protests in order to protect themselves and their fellow protestors FROM aggression, if it occurs. But this is a clear line that this administration has drawn to say that merely having a firearm on your person is a death sentence. Even if those were \"rogue agents,\" the administration has still backed them completely. That is approval. That is a green light to other officers to do the same.\n\nAnd I'm appalled at the 2A community. I always knew that the NRA and any organization was just political and wouldn't back the people, but the people aren't even backing the people. Now, I've been banned from every gun sub for asking how they can just sit by. For years, the only argument I've heard against common sense gun laws is that the Second Amendment is meant to be the people's check against tyranny.  And now that an unidentifiable and unaccountable police force is actively taking guns and murdering citizens for even carrying, they all go silent? I'm beyond disappointed.\n\nJust as a finishing note, there are those of us who are gun fans and see what's happening. I won't speak on this much because I don't want to get banned from reddit again, but you can go so far left that you support the Second Amendment again. If anyone reading this falls into that category, please be smart. I'm now torn weather to bring a concealed firearm to any action or protest. This man was detained, tried, and executed all in the span of about a minute by 6 men who are above the law. The murderer saw that the victim never resisted, saw the firearm removed from the equation, and decided that the victim should be executed for daring to bring a gun to protect his community. When he was being beaten by a violent gang, the victim decided not to even reach for his firearm. That is restraint, and that is the kind of person who *should* be carrying. The best advice I can give you is to find those around you with the same mind. Since our online social spaces aren't safe, don't try to organize there. We've all seen videos of local police and federal officers coming to citizens' homes with printouts of online posts that just called out right-wing politicians. And please, foreign allies, speak put and share your opinion about exactly what needs to be done. We aren't free to explore different solutions. So, please, have that difficult conversation for us. This is a way that you can help, regardless of how far away you are. And back to those who support the Secons Amendment in the States, find a community and organize. And, for all of our sakes, stay safe.",

You'd need a gun for that.\nIf you just like to shoot guns, I get that. It's fun, it takes skill.\n\nBut when I see people brandishing guns, and they give some spiel about it being necessary to ensure everyone's freedoms, Second Amendment, etc. I start wondering. And then, when the fascists get in power, fire up their camps to \"house\" the undesirables, shoot citizens in the street for daring to stand up, *they fucking disappear*. \n\nI'm not necessarily against guns; I'm against the gun culture that these apes stand for. \n\n&gt; And please, foreign allies, speak put and share your opinion about exactly what needs to be done. We aren't free to explore different solutions.\n\nOfficially, other countries will not be able to intervene, because the US has held elections and as a collective has decided they want to be led by paedophiles, fascists and sociopaths. That's political legitimacy.\n\nBut irrespective of whether the violent force is a foreign occupier or a domestic terrorist organisation, there have been resistance movements in the past who organised and sabotaged the enemy through non-violent means. I saw a video of Minnesotans doing just that, forming networks using radios, keeping an eye on these modern day Brownshirts and following them around, blowing whistles and honking horns. That's an attack on their morale, which is fantastic.\n\nIn the Netherlands, in 1941, there was the [February Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_strike). The country was occupied by the nazi's and they had started pogroms in Amsterdam to round up Jews.\n\nThe Communist Party then spread [flyers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Pamflet_Februaristaking_1941.jpg/960px-Pamflet_Februaristaking_1941.jpg) saying:\n\n&gt; Organise strikes in all companies!!! Fight united against this terror!!! Demand the release of the arrested Jews!!!\" ...  \n&gt; *Be aware of the enormous power of your act of unity!!!!*  \n&gt; It is many times greater than the German military occupation!  \n&gt; In your resistance you will no doubt find a large part of the German worker-soldiers on your side !!!  \n&gt; STRIKE!!! STRIKE!!! STRIKE!!!  \n&gt; For one day, cease all industry in Amsterdam, the docks, the factories, the workshops, the offices and the banks, municipal services and workplaces!! ...  \n&gt; Proudly fight for the liberation of our country! ...  \n&gt; Comrades, pass on this manifest after heaving read it! Put it up on walls wherever you can. *Be careful about it!*  \n\nHundreds of thousands of people ended up joining the strikes. I'm not saying this would end well; the February Strike was quickly met with violence, but it was the first time the Nazi treatment of Jews in Europe was so openly defied by so many people.\n\nAnd it shows how fearful the Nazi's were about not having the populace under their control, and how much they depended on people just going on with their work. These people that have taken over your country - and have been doing so for decades in the background - are leeches on you, the people of the country. They take your labour, your time, your money, and pretend they are its rightful owners because that is how they survive. What they fear most is that you will no longer spend your life playing their game.

Talk to us and encourage us to take action. \n\nI wasn't worried during the last election. I was so disappointed in what my fellow Americans had done, but at least they were such a small percentage of the population. Then, he won. And we all had to come to terms with the fact that we were wrong. But I still refuse to believe that they actually have the majority. Between gerrymandering, voter intimidation, and things like Musk offering 100k dollars to registered Republicans, they can't say that there was no tampering. We have the majority. Just keep speaking your mind about what needs to be done.",

According to local officials, the man was legally armed, a firearm was recovered at the scene, and he is believed to have been a lawful gun owner and permit to carry holder.  \n  \nMany critical facts remain unknown.\n\nWe do not yet have an independent account of what initiated the encounter or what triggered the use of deadly force. Despite widespread speculation regarding intent, there has been no evidence produced indicating an intent to harm the officers. We are calling for a full and transparent investigation by both state and federal authorities.\n\nEvery peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms—including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times.",

They might start firing directly into crowds of people with heavy artillery, in \"self defense\"\n* Trump and Noem will go absolutely beserk on this, and will call the national guard. There will be tanks and heavy military gear on the ground. He will say \"Told you so, insane unsafe city!\"\n* Eventually airforces will be set in and may start bombing the city\n* To follow for other Democrat cities.\n* More or less civil war in USA\n\n.. and NOBODY takes steps from rep. senators or house of rep.\n\nHow on earth USA is going to be ready in a few months to have a world event is beyond anyone.

However, ICE is literally going door to door, at businesses and homes, demanding people to provide proof of citizenship, and photographing them with facial recognition. Both citizens and non-citizens are being hassled, detained, arested, beaten, and killed. The photograph they take with their facial recognition app, allows them to pair your face with your online activities, past and future location data, people you associate with, careers, hobbies, financial data (including purchase history), political affiliations, people you interact with, plus the information they collect at the time to \"determine if you're a citizen.\" That information is saved forever, and is being fed into databases and Said.\n\nAlso, ICE agents have been given explicit instructions to violate the 4th amendment, and force entry into people's homes, without a judicial warrant.\n\nSo, how would \"going home\" help protect our rights?\n\nDo you support gangs of masked, anonymous, heavily armed soldiers, with complete immunity and no oversight, forcing their way into your home?\n\nHow would your family, and/or your children feel about that happening in your home?\n\nWould you feel safe and secure in your household, and free from unreasonable search or seizure without probable cause AND a court order, like it is guaranteed in the 4th amendment of the constitution?\n\nNobody is saying we don't need immigration enforcement. Obviously we do. \nHowever, we do NOT need roving squads of soldiers with full military garb, harassing law-abiding people when there is no evidence of a crime.\n\nPlease, we need everyone we can to stand up to unconstitutional behavior! I absolutely love the United States of America. My family has fought AND died to uphold the principles of our nation and our constitution. Those brave veterans did NOT just go home and pretend like there weren't injustices being done. I'm confident they would not consider that to be how a patriotic American behaves!\n\nI await your response!",

I also DO NOT condone any violence whatsoever\n\nOk so i typically don't comment on current events but this has got extremely out of hand. I made an account just to voice my outrage. To preface this rant, I am a Hispanic male who was born in the United States and have been a legal citizen my entire life. Politically I grew up in a very neutral, independent household. I have always, and will always believe in the constitution as it was the framework that built this country. I was taught not to get to wrapped up into politics and not to idolize any celeb, politician, etc. \n\nDue to the recent events around the nation, I have had to fear for the safety of my family in our everyday life. I am afraid to let my younger siblings leave the house on their own as I am not sure if they will ever come back.\n\nAs I previously stated, I fully believe in the constitution and from the way i interpret it, the murder of multiple people by federal agents during this raid seems like means to uphold the second amendment and bear arms against a Tyrannical government. I believe that this situation was exactly what the founding fathers were writing about in that paper over two centuries ago. I understand that it sounds extreme but the goal of these ICE raids now are to instill fear of the government in the people in an attempt to get them to submit to said government. I am not entirely sure what the ultimate goal is of this regime but I can only assume they have something much bigger planned once they prove that they have ultimate control. \n\nThank you for reading my rant and I am looking for any outside thoughts on this.\n\n",

      "text": "Papers Don’t Matter Anymore: ICE Turns Minnesota Into a Holding Zone\n\nMinnesota is no longer a state so much as a processing area. Over the past six weeks, federal immigration agents have moved through neighbourhoods, court steps, workplaces, and private homes with a blunt certainty: compliance first, clarification later.\n\nOfficials say the operation targets undocumented migrants. Residents tell a different story. U.S. citizens — born here, raised here, registered here — have been stopped, detained, questioned, and released hours later without charge or apology. Names misread. Databases lagging. Accents mistaken for status.\n\nDoors are opened by force. Men are taken outside half-dressed. Phones are seized. Legal counsel is delayed or denied. Families wait on sidewalks, watching federal vans disappear without knowing where their relatives are being held or when they will return.\n\nProtests have followed, and with them, pepper spray and mass arrests. A recent court decision cleared the way for ICE to detain demonstrators as part of enforcement operations, collapsing the line between immigration control and crowd control. The message is clear: resistance itself is now suspect.\n\nLocal police chiefs have quietly acknowledged what residents already know — racial profiling is no longer an allegation but a working method. Even off-duty officers have reportedly been stopped and questioned. Citizenship, once a shield, now functions more like a suggestion.\n\nAt the same time, federal subpoenas have landed on the desks of Minnesota officials who publicly opposed the crackdown. Dissent is being logged. Opposition is being investigated. Governance is being reframed as obstruction.\n\nWhat is unfolding in Minnesota is not chaos. It is order — a new one. One where status must be proven on demand, where rights are conditional, and where the burden of innocence rests with the detained.\n\nThe operation continues. The numbers grow. And across the state, people are learning a hard lesson: in an age of permanent enforcement, everyone is pre-screened, and no one is fully cleared.\n\nGC",

I have the utmost respect for people who carry on their traditions of educating and feeding the people and building strong communities. \n\nIt's time people realize that they need to abandon The Democratic Party and electoral politics in general. If you have any knowledge of US history, we have never achieved any justice for marginalized people and working class people by voting. It's people like the Panthers and people started unions, communists and socialists and abolitionists who put their lives on the line and risked their freedom who forced change\n\nThe political system in America has always been designed to be controlled by the elites. All the mythology about the founding fathers that they drill into our heads since we're 5 years old is just that. Mythology. Millionaire politicians will NEVER EVER be on your side.

Senators worked on that for months but Trump wanted to kill it so all these issues could’ve been fixed but Trump wanted to do what he’s doing now so he put a stop to it because that’s what he does. He creates problems or make some worse, and then he swoops in and says look at me. I’m the only one that can solve this. He does this over and over and over and over and the cultist still eat it up. They get online and start turning on Fox and OAN and to get their daily outrage. They’re so used to being fearful of everything and hating everything and disliking anything that isn’t like them. The call acts like immigration just started when Biden came to office. It’s been going on decades. Trump has just pissed Biden beat his ass. And the people like Biden no one really likes Trump. He kind of forces people to support him. He doesn’t have any friends he could trust cause he’s not trustworthy. Look what Jeffrey Epstein said about him. He has no scruples, no morals.He’s like the worst person he’s ever met.",

There’s plenty of names of the dead and traumatized whose perpetrators are here illegally. I don’t give a shit if they are from Sweden, Australia, the Congo, Somalia, or the arctic circle. EVERY ONE who has thought they are entitled enough to come here illegally needs to go. So stfu with your pandering woke bs assuming everyone is racist who doesn’t want illegals here. In every country the expectation is for you to assimilate to their way of life. I know may people from South America and Mexico that refuse to learn English and will live here 30+ years. English is the official language of the US. If you go to Japan you don’t expect everyone to know your language and adapt to your culture, YOU adapt to THEIRS. Same with every other place on the planet. Yes we are a melting pot of culture. That’s a strong suit. But coming here from a third country where it’s okay to shit in the river and dump trash wherever you want isn’t okay. I have seen it firsthand living in a sanctuary city how those people take care of the place they live, they turn it into a dump.",

In fact 20% of them don’t pay any taxes. (These are easy to find statistics btw) additionally they don’t assimilate to our culture, they are skipping the line of millions of others patiently waiting their turn to become American citizens, many of them have criminal records, the cartel is funded billions of dollars annually from the smuggling they do across the border and extort families, I think I read 70% or more of women end up victims of sexual assault during the crossing of the border? Or just end up getting trafficked entirely. Many die as well. It’s not just good people coming over here to live a good life there’s literally so many problems with it and that’s why EVERY. SINGLE. COUNTRY. Has border laws. The United States has never said “hey come on in whoever the fuck wants to, we don’t need any ID or anything just come over”. That’s a national security risk, a risk to our way of life, and if it can prevent even a single tragedy from taking place then it’s worth it.

Because everything I have found has stated they are not eligible for most social programs due to the lack of an SSI.\n\nThey don’t assimilate because there is nowhere in the US that states they have to? Bigotry on your part but whatever. We are a mixing pot, we have no single culture in the US and to think that is the case is like the most UnAmerican thing I have ever heard. And often times they do take on many of our values and culture while incorporating their own.\n\nAlso you lie about most having a criminal record because according to TracImmigration there are currently 65,735 Illegal Immigrants in I’ve custody and 76.3% of those have absolutely no prior felony convictions. So clearly ICE isn’t targeting those “violent” offenders.\n\nAnd that’s just from November of last year before they started going buck wild and detaining anyone who refused to give them paperwork, identify themselves as citizens because why would they have to, or were racially profiled due to their accent or tone of skin. \n\nMany are currently working towards their citizenship and being detained outside of their court hearings, so tell me how are they to even try and become citizens, if the very institutions of our country is working against them? \n\nThe 5th and 6th Amendment give them the right to attorney in the government’s attempt to deport them and the INA 8 U.S.C. S 1362 further emphasizes their right to council and yet they are being denied that right a majority of the time due to illegal and immoral decisions made by POTUS and his cabinet. \n\nYou’re also not going to bring up the fact that it is coming out that they are being sexually assaulted in detention by ICE agents? Where is the justice in that? This is a problem that hasn’t been addressed by Donald Trump who did nothing his first term when there was a total of about 922 Sexual Assault allegations pressed forward against ICE and its agents? \n\nIt boggles my mind the sheer vitriol you display because they aren’t “Americans” this won’t change your mind, you’ll throw dubious numbers at me or rage and that’s fine.

      "text": "Allegations of Homicide Shake El Paso ICE Detention Centre\n\nEL PASO, TEXAS — The death of a man inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre near El Paso has triggered national scrutiny after indications from investigators suggest the case may be ruled a homicide, raising serious questions about the use of force by detention staff.\n\nThe man, 55 year old Cuban national Geraldo Lunas Campos, died on January 3 while being held at Camp East Montana, a large tent style detention facility located at Fort Bliss. ICE initially stated that Campos was found in medical distress and that life saving efforts were unsuccessful, offering little detail about the circumstances leading to his death.\n\nThat account has since been challenged. Information shared with the family indicates the El Paso County medical examiner believes Campos died from asphyxia caused by compression to the neck and chest, a finding consistent with death during physical restraint. A final determination is pending toxicology results, but investigators have reportedly signalled the manner of death is likely to be classified as homicide.\n\nICE has maintained that Campos attempted suicide and became violent during an encounter with staff, claiming officers intervened to prevent self harm. The agency also cited past criminal convictions and said he had been placed in segregation following a dispute related to medication.\n\nA different picture has emerged from inside the facility. A fellow detainee has stated that Campos refused to enter segregation and was restrained by multiple guards. According to this witness, Campos repeatedly said he could not breathe while being held down, before losing consciousness.\n\nThe incident has intensified criticism of ICE detention conditions, particularly at temporary or tent based facilities. Advocacy groups note that 2025 was the deadliest year on record for deaths in ICE custody and that multiple fatalities have already occurred in the opening days of 2026. Overcrowding, medical neglect and aggressive restraint practices have been longstanding concerns.\n\nFederal investigators have been in contact with the family, though ICE has not publicly acknowledged a homicide finding. Civil liberties organisations argue the case highlights the lack of transparency and accountability within the immigration detention system, where detainees are held under civil authority yet often subjected to carceral force.\n\nAs investigations continue, the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos has become a flashpoint in a broader debate over how the United States treats people in immigration custody and whether current enforcement practices are compatible with basic standards of human life and dignity.",

      "text": "A Shovel, a Gun, and the Fast Track to Civil Unrest\n\nAnother person has been shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, this time after what officials describe as a dispute involving a shovel. By now, the details almost feel interchangeable. A tense arrest. A chaotic confrontation. A firearm drawn. A life changed in seconds.\n\nWhether a shovel was raised, swung, or simply present is no longer the central issue. What matters is how frequently immigration enforcement now ends with gunfire. What was once administrative has hardened into something openly coercive, backed not by courts but by weapons, carried into neighbourhoods already strained by fear and mistrust.\n\nThis shooting follows closely on the heels of other ICE encounters that turned violent, including one that ended in death. Each incident is treated as isolated. Each is justified as unavoidable. Yet together they show a rapid acceleration. The threshold for force keeps dropping, while the consequences keep rising.\n\nWhen armed federal agents conduct civil enforcement in residential spaces, escalation is not a mistake. It is built in. Communities begin to see the state not as a regulator, but as an occupying force. Resistance hardens. Fear spreads. Rumours travel faster than facts. Every new shooting becomes a spark in an environment soaked with fuel.\n\nThis is how civil unrest moves from protest to something darker. Not overnight, but quickly enough that no one can pretend they did not see it coming. When disputes over paperwork are settled with bullets, the line between law enforcement and internal conflict collapses. History is clear on what follows.\n\nThis is no longer a warning phase. This is momentum.\n\nGC",

        "body": "It would be a shame if the protesters began making their signs out of quarter-inch-thick plywood to stop rubber bullets, forming a tight shield wall to prevent police from singling out and mobbing individual protesters. It would be a shame if the people behind the shield wall held up umbrellas so that tear gas canisters fired over their heads on the front line will be bounced away. It would be a shame if protesters began constructing improvised armor vests out of duct tape, hard-backed books, and ceramic tiles.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters started wearing safety glasses, hard hats, respirators, and gardening gloves, all of which can be found at the same hardware stores as the plywood. It would be a shame if they started using traffic cones (the kind without the hole in the top), upside down buckets, or other improvised lids to contain teargas by placing them over the canisters.\n\nIt would be a shame if protesters learned that police scanners are legal to own in the US, allowing them to learn where police are moving, and what routes they intend to take. It would be a shame if they discovered that these scanners can be used to send as well as receive, allowing them to flood the scanner frequencies with noise.\n\nAll of this would be a terrible, terrible shame.\n\n*It would be an awful shame if you copied and pasted this, so that they couldn't delete the original and all linked posts (again).\n\n**An even worse shame would be to start donating these items to protesters.\n\nLink to original comment creator: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnderReportedNews/s/W5S5HumTVL",

Flooding police channels with data is against FCC laws, at that point you're legitimately committing a crime by blocking any kind of radio frequency. Not to mention your location isn't hidden when broadcasting. It would be an awesome way to disrupt, but i think the citizens should keep to legally protesting so as not to add legitimate claims to ICE's bullshit propaganda. Florida statute Chapter 843, Section 165, also outlined in section 333 of communication act. Keep the peace even if they don't, America will know the time for a full revolution if the time comes, let's hope it never gets to that point though. Everything else is a fantastic idea. I saw some people using grabber claws to chuck the tear gas canisters back behind their lines, those things get stupid hot, be careful.\n\nEdit: the florida law calls it a misdemeanor but FCC will take it way further. Up to $100k fines per day and fines like that are usually more felony territory. A protester is no good in a jail where nobody can hear you.",

      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "This Isn’t a Police State, Until It Is: ICE Arresting U.S. Citizens Is Pure Madness\n\nIt is one thing to argue about immigration policy. It is something else entirely to watch federal agents treat the Constitution like a technical suggestion. Across parts of the United States this winter, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has crossed a line that should alarm anyone who believes citizenship still means something.\n\nICE agents have now detained, assaulted, and in at least one case killed people who were not undocumented migrants at all, but American citizens going about their lives. Business owners, workers, and bystanders have been swept up in operations that appear careless at best and authoritarian at worst. These are not border towns or ports of entry. These are neighbourhoods, workplaces, and streets.\n\nOne of the most jarring cases involved a U.S. citizen gun shop owner, a person who by every stereotype likely supported Trump and backed aggressive immigration enforcement. He was reportedly detained despite being licensed, compliant, and legally armed. That irony should be impossible to ignore. The very constituency that demanded tougher enforcement is now discovering that federal power does not stop to check voting records or bumper stickers.\n\nIn another incident, U.S. citizens were forcibly detained by ICE agents outside a major retail store, pushed to the ground, and temporarily disappeared into unmarked vehicles before being released. No clear warrants. No immediate explanation. Just force, confusion, and fear. For many Americans, it was the first time they understood what it feels like to have your rights ignored because an agent decided speed mattered more than accuracy.\n\nThe most disturbing case ended in death. A U.S. citizen was shot and killed during an ICE encounter, sparking mass protests and national outrage. Officials rushed to defend the agent involved, but public trust evaporated almost instantly. When immigration enforcement agencies are roaming cities armed and empowered to make split second decisions about who belongs and who does not, the risk is no longer theoretical.\n\nThis is not immigration policy. This is federal overreach colliding with everyday life. When ICE arrests citizens, the issue is no longer border security. It is civil liberty collapse.\n\nCitizenship is supposed to be a shield. Right now, it looks more like a suggestion.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Watching America Slide Toward the Unthinkable\n\nI am writing this as someone watching events accelerate beyond the point of denial. What is happening in the United States right now is not routine political conflict or partisan noise. It is systemic stress pushing a powerful country toward fracture, with consequences that will reach far beyond its borders.\n\nInside the United States, federal power is being used in ways that many Americans no longer recognize as democratic. ICE raids have expanded aggressively, sweeping up people with legal status and even citizens. Deadly encounters involving immigration enforcement have intensified fear rather than safety. These actions are not calming tensions. They are inflaming them, especially in communities already under pressure.\n\nAt the same time, Donald Trump is openly attacking the mechanics of voting itself. There is a sustained push to restrict or eliminate mail ballots, even though this is the very method Trump himself uses to vote. That contradiction matters. It exposes the issue for what it is, not election integrity, but election control. Mail ballots protect access for seniors, rural voters, disabled Americans, and working people. Removing them reshapes the electorate by design.\n\nThis effort is not happening in isolation. The broader objective appears clear to many Americans across the political spectrum. Rigging the 2026 midterms is not about winning an argument. It is about maintaining Republican control of Congress in order to shield Trump from impeachment and accountability. When elections are treated as obstacles rather than mandates, democracy stops functioning.\n\nThis collapse of trust is happening while the United States is projecting force across the globe. Venezuela. Iran. Gaza. Yemen. Cuba. Greenland. Increasing pressure on Canada and Mexico. Talk of future confrontation involving Brazil and Colombia. These are not isolated policies. They form a pattern of expansion, coercion, and brinkmanship that strains alliances and destabilizes entire regions.\n\nWhat alarms me most is the growing contradiction in American foreign policy. The United States could find itself fighting alongside NATO in one conflict while clashing with NATO allies in another. Standing with Europe against Russia and China rhetorically, while alienating Europe through unilateral action in practice. This is how alliances fracture. This is how wars spiral beyond control.\n\nAll of this feeds back into domestic collapse. If there is a civil war in America, it will not resemble the past. It will be asymmetrical. Federal agencies like ICE operating with expanded authority. A military constrained by legal and moral divisions. National Guard units answering to governors with opposing loyalties. Regional police forces split by ideology. Armed militias acting independently. And millions of civilians caught between competing centers of power.\n\nThat is not speculation. That is the logical outcome when elections are undermined, institutions are politicized, and force replaces consent.\n\nThe unresolved Epstein scandal continues to deepen divisions on the right, feeding suspicion that powerful figures are protected while ordinary citizens are punished. This belief is corrosive. It convinces people that the system is rigged beyond repair, and once that belief becomes widespread, violence becomes easier to justify in the minds of some.\n\nHovering above all of this is the influence of multinational corporations and billionaires. Extreme wealth concentration has distorted both domestic policy and foreign intervention. Global inequality is not an accident. It is the product of decisions made by people insulated from consequences. When corporate power merges with political authority, democracy becomes ornamental.\n\nFrom outside the United States, this is terrifying to watch. Economies are intertwined. Security is intertwined. The future is intertwined. A destabilized America does not fracture quietly. It sends shockwaves across the world.\n\nTo Americans reading this, this moment is real. What is tolerated now will define what comes next. When voting rights are stripped, when fear replaces law, when accountability is blocked to protect one man, the road leads not to stability but to conflict.\n\nIt feels as though the United States is standing at the edge of a civil war while simultaneously edging the world toward a wider one. The ground is already shifting. The only question left is how far it will crack.\n\nGC",

      "text": "The recent murder of a US citizen by Ice in Minnesota, immediately followed by the mother who ordered door dash only to have her delivery driver chased inside  her home in fear by gestapo agents, are just two prominent examples that we really don't know what to do when these things happen.   I fear they will become more and more common.  Citizens need to know that ICE can lie to you....even the police can lie to you and it's well within their rights to do so.   We need to know what to do and who to call.\n\nI am looking for someone to help me create a website with information on what to do in these situations because I fear they are going to be more and more common.   Something that will list numbers for lawyers and victims advocates that you can call when you are in a state of panic... And also general information about what documentation is required and the very very important information that the obviously ICE will lie to you, but also the COPS WILL DEFINITELY LIE TO YOU AS WELL.      It is well within the purview of what they can do, and it doesn't surprise me at all that they did in order to try to deescalate the situation. \n\nNot all cops are bad, but all of them are friends with these punks as well and a lot of them share the same maga mindset. \n\nI think having all this information in one place could save lives, and at the very least save some good people from future PTSD and all kinds of trauma. \n\nWe could have the website blasted out by influencers with large followings... We could also have bullet points printed out to pass out at protests. \n\nI need help with translations and making sure I get all the legal details right.   Is there anyone willing to help?  ",

      "text": "I believe the United States should enforce its borders and maintain an orderly immigration system. A country that cannot control who enters is not fully sovereign laws, planning, and safety matter. Coming here illegally cannot simply be ignored, because selective enforcement undermines the law, hurts citizens, legal immigrants, and even the migrants themselves.\nAt the same time, enforcement must be accountable. ICE agents should wear body cameras, display visible identification, and operate under strict oversight, except in cases where exposing them would put them or their families at risk, such as operations against cartels, gangs, or smuggling networks. Psychological screening, thorough vetting including social media and past behavior and longer training are essential. Anyone given authority over another person’s life should meet higher standards than average government employees.\nI draw a clear line between criminals and noncriminals. Someone living quietly, working, paying rent, and raising children should not be treated the same as someone committing violence or trafficking drugs. Deportation for non-criminals should be carried out humanely, with proper legal documentation, court hearings, and due process.\nEnforcement and empathy are not mutually exclusive. A nation can protect its sovereignty, uphold the law, and still preserve human dignity. History shows that order and legitimacy endure when authority is exercised with fairness and accountability. Extremes on either side chaos or cruelty erode society. The goal is the hard middle: a system that commands respect because it is both lawful and humane.",

Independent investigations, transparent training standards, and public accountability are what build trust and prevent abuses; without them, we’re stuck with the same problems critics point to now.",

      "title": "ICE Thugs on American Streets: Agent Kills US Citizen / This is What I Saw",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "ICE Thugs on American Streets: What I Saw on Television\n\nBy GC\n\nI watched the footage on television today, and what I saw disturbed me deeply. An American citizen lay dead in her vehicle after being shot by an ICE agent during a massive immigration operation in Minneapolis. What followed on my screen did not look like law enforcement maintaining order. It looked like intimidation, panic, and raw power exercised without restraint.\n\nFrom what I could see, the streets were swarming with federal agents in tactical gear, weapons drawn, shouting commands in a residential neighbourhood. The scale of the operation alone felt excessive. It looked less like policing and more like an occupying force descending on a city that did not ask for it.\n\nThe official explanation, as relayed by federal authorities, is that the agent acted in self defence, claiming the woman used her car as a weapon. But watching the video myself, I did not see a clear, immediate threat that justified deadly force. I saw a vehicle boxed in by armed agents. I saw confusion. I saw escalation. And then I saw gunfire.\n\nWhat unsettled me most was the aftermath. As the woman sat mortally wounded inside the car, people from the neighbourhood appeared to rush forward, visibly distressed, trying to help. On my screen, agents pushed them back, guns raised, voices barking orders. To me, it felt cruel. The priority did not appear to be saving a life. It appeared to be asserting control.\n\nI could not help but think about Minneapolis’ history, about how recent and unresolved the trauma still is there. Watching another killing by armed authorities unfold in that same city felt surreal, like history repeating itself in real time while the country argues over terminology and jurisdiction.\n\nProtests followed quickly, and that reaction made sense to me. If this is what immigration enforcement looks like on live television, then something has gone very wrong. When agencies tasked with civil enforcement operate with military posture and lethal outcomes, public trust evaporates.\n\nI am not claiming to know every detail of what happened. I am not inside the investigation rooms or the briefing halls. I am reacting as a viewer, as a citizen, watching events unfold through the same videos now circulating everywhere. Based on what I saw, this did not look inevitable. It looked avoidable.\n\nFederal officials say investigations are underway, and perhaps facts will emerge that complicate what appears so clear on first viewing. But there is also a long history of reviews that lead nowhere, of deaths that fade from the news cycle without accountability. Watching this, it is hard not to feel cynical.\n\nAn American citizen is dead. Armed immigration agents controlled the scene. Neighbours were kept back at gunpoint. Those are not interpretations. Those are images that played out on television screens across the country.\n\nI will leave a link to the footage of the killing and its aftermath so readers can judge for themselves. But as I watched it today, I could not shake the feeling that something fundamental has shifted, that lines meant to protect civilians are being erased in plain sight.\n\nIf this is the new normal, it is a frightening one.\n\nHere is the video link ( warning - the video is disturbing and shows the citizen being shot and an attempt to administer CPR to the victim ).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LnfiWmX_mTE?si=1FOXAlygfhLYnpHZ. \n\n",

It is entirely likely that in the confusion and chaos created by these ICE officers in their intimidating paramilitary gear, dressed and armed for war, that a person might be fearful and attempt to flee. The way this administration has latched onto the claim this woman was a “domestic terrorist” using her car as a deadly weapon to justify the killing, when the plain evidence does not support such a definitive conclusion, is chilling. They will never admit their wrongdoing and I hope there will be accountability in the near future.",

Christie Noem and her bully boys are nothing but the latest incarnation of fascism on our streets . And your aversion for colorful hair gives your hive mind status away. It's  a cliche' from ten years ago , not reality.  And if some people are still wearing it we aren't a monolith like you. Pointing out that Nick Shirley is a scumbag grifter is not supporting fraud . Two things can be true at once. Unbelievable that you idiots are still unaware of the truth here. There ARE 80 some people in prison from three years ago , there ARE still investigations. But bringing in Noem's fucking gestapo isn't the right way to deal with it. It's not even the correct agency to deal with fraud. But they WANT to bully Somalian people. And btw the head of the scammers was a white woman who is now in prison.  As for Maduro AGAIN you can't understand two things can be true at once. Trump kidnapping someone from another country and killing 80 people to do so, has been already called out by the UN. No words to congress,  nothing. And now he's threatening more of our allies, including Greenland Europe Mexico and  Canada . This is fucking insanity . This is gonna lead to another world war but you still think Murkkkaaaa winninggg . idiotic.",

      "text": "Extremism in the Ranks, Not the Majority\n\nClaims that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are mostly far-right extremists do not stand up to the evidence. What the record does show, however, is a persistent and troubling pattern of documented extremist affiliations among a minority of officers, alongside institutional failures to adequately detect or deter them.\n\nMultiple investigations over the past decade, including U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General reviews and congressional inquiries, have confirmed that some ICE and Customs and Border Protection personnel participated in or expressed support for extremist movements, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters. In 2019, investigative reporting revealed hundreds of border enforcement officers active in secret Facebook groups that shared racist, anti-Muslim and violent content. DHS later acknowledged gaps in screening and discipline.\n\nFederal prosecutors have since charged several current or former law enforcement officers, including individuals linked to DHS agencies, for roles connected to the January 6 insurrection, militia organising or unlawful weapons activity. While these cases represent a small fraction of the workforce, they reinforce warnings from the FBI and DHS that white supremacist and anti-government groups actively seek to recruit people with law enforcement training and access.\n\nCrucially, no credible data supports the assertion that ICE agents as a whole or by majority belong to extremist organisations. ICE employs tens of thousands of officers, the vast majority of whom have no known ties to such movements. Oversimplifying the issue risks obscuring the real problem: systemic vulnerabilities, weak oversight and inconsistent accountability that allow extremist actors to pass through or remain within federal agencies.\n\nThe evidence points not to a force dominated by extremists, but to a democratic institution struggling to confront radicalisation within its margins. That distinction matters, especially as public trust, civil liberties and the rule of law remain at stake on both sides of the border.",

      "text": "ICE Exodus: Agents Leaving as Violence, Morale, and Leadership Turmoil Soar\n\nA growing number of ICE agents are resigning as the agency faces an unprecedented combination of escalating violence, collapsing morale, and internal political upheaval.\n\nAssaults on ICE personnel have surged dramatically over the past year, rising by hundreds of percent compared with 2024. Agents report being targeted both on and off duty, with some describing incidents where officers were dragged by vehicles during arrests or had threats made against their families. The sharp rise in danger has intensified burnout and fear, prompting many long-serving agents to walk away.\n\nInternally, morale has cratered. Many agents say the enforcement environment has shifted toward aggressive, high-volume deportation quotas that prioritize numbers over complex investigative work such as human trafficking, organized crime, or transnational fraud. Staff describe a climate of pressure where they feel they are being pushed toward politically driven metrics rather than meaningful public-safety outcomes.\n\nMaking matters worse, 2025 saw a sweeping leadership overhaul in which roughly half of ICE’s field office directors were replaced, many of them with current or former Border Patrol officials. Critics argue that this transition has deepened cultural tensions within the agency, importing management styles seen as more militarized and less focused on nuanced investigative operations. Agents say the shake-up has disrupted chain of command stability, worsened communication, and contributed to widespread uncertainty.\n\nIn response to the exodus, ICE has accelerated hiring efforts, issuing more than a thousand tentative job offers and offering unprecedented incentives such as large signing bonuses and expanded student loan forgiveness. Despite these measures, recruitment is struggling to keep pace with resignations, and many inside the agency question whether ICE can maintain operational capacity if current trends continue.\n\nAs 2025 closes, the departures raise difficult questions about the sustainability of the agency’s approach and whether its mission can be carried out effectively amid rising hostility, internal turmoil, and intensifying political pressure.\n\nGC",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Why ICE Agents Overreact\n\nBy GC\n\nIn recent years, the behaviour of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has raised a serious question: why do its agents so often appear to overreact? From aggressive raids to confrontational street encounters, the pattern is hard to ignore. While immigration enforcement is inherently difficult, the level of force and anxiety surrounding many of these interactions goes beyond what most people would consider reasonable.\n\nPart of the problem lies in the culture that has developed inside the agency. For years, ICE has been framed as the “last line of defence” against everything from undocumented workers to national security threats. When a department builds its identity around crisis and danger, its frontline agents start to interpret every situation through that lens. Fear replaces judgment, and overreaction becomes the default.\n\nAnother factor is political pressure. ICE is constantly pushed to deliver results that can be turned into talking points—numbers of arrests, dramatic footage, big operations. When success is measured by visible action rather than careful decision-making, agents become more inclined to escalate even minor encounters.\n\nFinally, inadequate oversight and inconsistent training leave too much room for individual interpretation. In an environment where guidance is vague, accountability is uneven, and public scrutiny is high, some agents resort to excessive control simply because they believe it’s safer—for their careers and for themselves.\n\nOverreaction doesn’t make communities more secure. It breeds mistrust, inflames tensions, and undermines the very legitimacy of immigration enforcement. If the United States wants a system that protects both public safety and human dignity, it needs an agency that acts with restraint, professionalism, and respect—not one conditioned to see every shadow as a threat.\n",

      "text": "ICE on Thin Ice as Epstein’s Emails Shake Washington\n\nBy GC\n\nNew York City is about to see a showdown that no one expected and it could change how federal and city power interact. With tensions rising over immigration raids, the NYPD is quietly signalling that if ICE agents break local or state laws during their operations, they won’t be treated as untouchable. They could actually face arrest like anyone else. It’s a stunning shift, and for many New Yorkers it feels long overdue.\n\nThis local pushback is happening at the exact same moment Washington is being rattled by a fresh wave of Epstein’s emails being released. The timing couldn’t be worse for the political elite. These new messages are said to include uncomfortable connections, timelines, and private exchanges that Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson would rather never see daylight. Their public behaviour this week hasn’t helped either, as both men have been scrambling to dismiss the leaks while refusing to answer basic questions from reporters.\n\nWhat’s happening in New York is simple. The city is drawing a line, saying no federal badge gives anyone the right to break the law, abuse power, or ignore local protections. If ICE decides to cross that line, the NYPD may finally be ready to hold them accountable. What’s happening in Washington is something else entirely—a panic ripple hitting the top of the political food chain as the ghosts of Epstein’s world return.\n\nPut the two together and you get a moment where the powerful are wobbling, and the people on the ground are finally pushing back.",

They have more cash to bribe potential ICE and DHS agents or family members close to them. \n\nThis happened throughout the super violent 1980's in the US when corrupt law enforcement looked the other way as drug cartels infiltrated cities and destroyed many..  a good number of Netflix crime action dramas are based on them, unfortunately some romanticized it but never show effects on local kids and various people who had to alter their lifestyle to avoid gangs shootouts in their neighborhoods, how local shops were affected, and everyone had to steer clear of open assassinations happening in broad daylight. \n\nFrom specific parts of Florida to NYC this was unfortunately too common. When it wasn't drug cartels creating violence it was the mob/mafia partnered with them, who also paid off corrupt cops.",

Obviously it’s little more than a theoretical, but when paired with the fact that the immigration methods being used could potentially push otherwise normal people to fall for any attempts at recruitment from cartels offering protection and suddenly there could be quite a few members who don’t have a prior record signing up. \n\nThere’s also the fact that impersonating ICE seems like a great way for organised crime in general to target largely nine white competitors. You can literally show up without warning, abduct important competitors and be gone without law enforcement even questioning it depending on the execution and location.\n\nAgain, just a theoretical and hopefully it stays that way.

They’re trained to uphold transparency and accountability. So why isn’t ICE held to the same standard?\n\nPlease sign and spread the link around. Stay safe and protect your neighbors. \n\n[https://c.org/qg7Qjt2PGj](https://c.org/qg7Qjt2PGj)\n\n  \nThank you!",

It argues that mass deportations don’t make America stronger; they make it poorer, weaker and less free. These are not partisan talking points, but sober discussion of the data available to us, sharpened against conscience.\n\nUsing data from the Center for American Progress, the Cato Institute, and the *American Journal of Sociology* among others, I show that deporting workers actually *shrinks* the economy and destroys families without increasing safety. The piece also explores the psychological toll, and the way children develop trauma and mistrust that lasts a lifetime. Interested to see what others think of my arguments.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI work with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm, and we’re representing Leo Garcia Venegas (shown in the video below).\n\nLeo, a U.S. citizen, was detained by federal agents twice while working on a construction site in Alabama. Both times, he showed valid ID — and both times, agents ignored it. These warrantless raids on private property violate the Fourth Amendment, and Leo is now suing.\n\nWe’re looking for other U.S. citizens (or people who know them) who’ve been detained or questioned by ICE while working.\n\nIf this has happened to you or someone you know, please share your story through the linked form. Your experiences can make a real difference.\n\nEnglish: [https://ij.org/case-intake/government-raids-on-construction-sites/](https://ij.org/case-intake/government-raids-on-construction-sites/)\n\nEspañol: [https://ij.org/case-intake/redadas-gubernamentales-en-sitios-de-construccion/](https://ij.org/case-intake/redadas-gubernamentales-en-sitios-de-construccion/)\n\n\\*We treat all information submitted through this form as confidential and will use it only for the purpose of evaluating the request for representation. Submitting the information does not mean that we have agreed to represent you or that we will represent you.\\*",

First offenses are typically misdemeanors, punishable by a fine, imprisonment for up to six months, or both. Subsequent offenses carry stiffer penalties, including fines and imprisonment for up to two years. \nKey Aspects of 8 U.S.C. § 1325\nImproper Time or Place: Entering the U.S. at a location other than a designated port of entry. \nEluding Examination: Circumventing examination or inspection by immigration officers. \nFalse or Misleading Representation: Using a willfully false or misleading statement or the willful concealment of a material fact to gain entry. \nPenalties \nFirst Offense: A fine or imprisonment of up to six months, or both.\nSubsequent Offenses: A fine or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.\nDistinction from Civil Offenses\nCivil Penalties: In addition to the criminal penalties, 8 U.S.C. § 1325 also provides for civil penalties, such as a fine, for being apprehended while attempting to enter at an unauthorized place. \nAdministrative Consequences: People may also face administrative processing for removal (deportation) for an unauthorized entry. \nRelated Statute: 8 U.S.C. § 1326 \nA related criminal offense is 8 U.S.C. § 1326, which addresses illegal reentry (re-entering the U.S. after being previously deported or denied admission) and is generally a felony offense.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Capital in Crisis: What’s Happening in D.C. Is Not What You Think\n\nBy GC\n\nThe corridors of power in the U.S. capital are not merely tense, they are collapsing into a machination that most observers will continue to misunderstand. Today, I confront the duplicity shadowing Washington with a dystopian gaze, drawing upon the incisive observations offered by investigative journalist Whitney Webb on the latest episode of Only The SAVVY.\n\nA State Without Illusions\n\nWe stand at a precipice. Webb reveals that the democratic façade is deteriorating, usurped by intertwined networks of surveillance, oligarchic control, and policy manipulation. This isn’t alarmism, it is the factual fallout of decades long policy convergence between government agencies and private intelligence contractors. That convergence has turned D.C. into a labyrinth of interests that even insiders struggle to navigate.\n\nDigital Panopticons &amp; Shadow Governance\n\nWebb underscores how the state is quietly extending its tentacles deep into our digital existence. Every keystroke, every click, every metadata point feeds into intelligence matrices. We’re fast approaching a tipping point where privacy is not only eroded, it is essentially extinct. This shift doesn’t just threaten free speech, it threatens the very notion of autonomous thought.\n\nAt the tip of this spear sits Peter Thiel and his creation, Palantir. Marketed as a “data analytics” company, Palantir is in truth the backbone of modern surveillance infrastructure, fusing intelligence databases with predictive policing and military strategy. Thiel, often presented as a visionary entrepreneur, is better understood as the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz, orchestrating systems of control that most citizens will never even glimpse. His fingerprints are on border security projects, counterterrorism networks, and domestic monitoring grids. Washington provides the theatre, but Thiel provides the script.\n\nCanada is not immune. Palantir has quietly secured contracts with the RCMP, the Department of National Defence, and health authorities during the pandemic. Its software was used to coordinate vaccine distribution and medical supply chains. It also pitched its Foundry platform to Canadian defence planners as part of a push for “joint all-domain command and control,” a military concept directly lifted from U.S. warfighting doctrine. Even the federal procurement database shows Palantir seeking inroads into Transport Canada and Public Safety. These are not marginal contracts, they are the embedding of a foreign surveillance firm into the very arteries of our state.\n\nThe RCMP’s controversial “Project Wide Awake”—a social media surveillance program—was supported by Palantir’s data tools. The Department of National Defence funded trials under its IDEaS (Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security) program, giving Palantir access to Canadian military research streams. Ontario Health and other provincial agencies explored Palantir’s Foundry platform during COVID-19, handing sensitive health data to an American intelligence-linked corporation with almost no transparency to the public.\n\nThe paper trail is clear. In 2020, the Department of National Defence paid Palantir $1.2 million for “software licensing and data services.” In 2021, Ontario Health signed a contract worth $1.6 million for Palantir’s Foundry platform during the pandemic. The RCMP, through publicly posted procurement data, entered a service agreement with Palantir valued at $595,000 for digital analysis tools. Small figures by Pentagon standards, but for Canada, these contracts represent a dangerous foothold — beachheads into sensitive law enforcement, defence, and health infrastructures.\n\nWhile Ottawa frames this as “efficiency” and “security,” the reality is the outsourcing of sovereignty to a private company whose loyalties lie not with Canadians, but with profit and power.\n\nThis is not a new pattern. Since the end of the Second World War, Canada has been a junior partner in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. That agreement bound our intelligence agencies into the same surveillance orbit as Washington. The groundwork for Palantir’s infiltration was laid decades ago, when Canadian governments accepted that intelligence sharing with allies meant quietly bypassing the Charter rights of their own citizens. Palantir is not an aberration, it is the logical next step in a process that has been eroding our sovereignty since 1946.\n\nFrom a Canadian vantage, this is not some distant dystopian fiction. It is already here, baked into our institutions.\n\nDisinformation as a Tool of Social Control\n\nOne of Webb’s most chilling points is how orchestrated misinformation now functions as both weapon and shield. Official narratives are carefully calibrated to distract, divide, and diffuse dissent, labelling real concerns as “conspiracy theories” while actual conspiracies proliferate unchecked.\n\nHere’s where I align, I’ve followed the data too. Public trust in institutions has been slipping steadily since the early 2020s, polls, peer reviewed studies, credible journalism all point to a growing disconnect between rulers and ruled. And what fills that void? Narratives spun not to inform but to pacify.\n\nThe International Entanglement\n\nWashington’s dystopia is not confined within U.S. borders. Webb points to its ripple effects, Canada, Europe, and other democracies increasingly mirror the same tendencies, policy capture by tech security complexes, seamless extradition mechanisms, and aggressive data sharing agreements. Even in our own Liberal majority government, signs of compromising national sovereignty in exchange for cross border “safety” are becoming too frequent to ignore.\n\nMy Perspective, Rational, Relentless, Resolute\n\nI reject fatalism. We are not extras in this play, we are observers, and actors. The facts are clear,\n\n 1. Technological infrastructure: Surveillance capability has exploded, satellites, drones, AI. We can no longer pretend our privacy is intact.\n\n 2. Corporate government liaisons: No longer partnerships, they are entanglements. Tech firms and intelligence agencies basically operate in tandem, prosecuting power through algorithms as much as policy. Palantir’s deep integration with law enforcement, military systems, and even Canadian federal agencies is the clearest example of this.\n\n 3. Narrative engineering: If enough people believe a lie, it becomes real. That’s been weaponized.\n\nSo what do we do? We shine light. We demand transparency in data practices. We legislate binding constraints on surveillance. We fortify journalistic independence. We resist becoming passive consumers of whatever narrative is fed to us.\n\nThe Dystopia Isn’t Fiction, Yet It Can Be Reversed\n\nIn dystopian fiction, citizens succumb. In reality, citizens, especially those with awareness and resources, can resist. Our sentence isn’t sealed, the narrative isn’t predetermined. Parliament Hill here in Canada and the Capitol Building in Washington need to hear our voices, loudly, clearly, urgently.\n\nBecause what’s happening in D.C. truly is not what we think, and if we don’t act, the thing it is will become our permanent reality.\n\nFinal Reflection\n\nInvestigative truths, like underground rivers, eventually find light. Whitney Webb gave us a glimpse into those currents. Now, it’s on us, armed with scepticism and resolve, to surface those truths, debate them, and reclaim democratic space. Anything less would be complicity in our own erasure.\n\n— Grant Coleman\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qkG2UJXNGeg?si= ",

Thankfully your delusions keep you scared, confused, and angry, all the things that'll bring about a heart attack.",

That's proven by the fact that we came up with that moniker for him. He had many flaws, but also many strengths. He also wasn't cruel about it, which Trump most definitely is. He didn't deport them to third party countries into concentration camps. he didn't send active military into streets to help terrorize both non-citizens and citizens alike. He didn't detain US citizens for days or weeks only to release them without charges. Nor did he go after green card holders who have been in this country for decades. Or students for co-authoring op-eds critical of Israel's actions. He didn't abandon our allies and everything this country stood for, nor talked about running for a third term.\n\nI can't wait to see the looks on his rural supporters when their hospitals shut down because of the big ugly bill. It's hilarious how he's turning on his followers, making their lives that much more difficult, but y'all just keep supporting him regardless. And every little thing y'all claim to care about you just conveniently change your minds after he betrays your ideals. Just like how y'all used to claim you cared about the Epstein files and supposedly child sexual abuse, but then a bunch of you are now claiming it's fine unless the child is under 10. Like they're seriously justifying if he were to have trafficked 10 year olds. That's just sick. Instead y'all chased imaginary pizza parlor basements, and Republicans have ALWAYS underfunded CPS agencies throughout the country.\n\nBut like I said, you did it again so I doubt you'll care about anything I've said.",

      "text": "“First They Came for the Truth: America’s Descent into Fascist Paranoia”\n\nBy Grant Coleman \n\nIn the early 1930s, the German Reichstag passed the Enabling Act. Under the pretext of national emergency and social disorder, dissent was criminalized, independent journalism was silenced, and critics of the regime were hunted down in the name of national security. Today, in the United States of America—under the guidance of a newly emboldened Trump regime—the pattern is repeating with unnerving precision. But this time, the knock on the door isn’t coming from the Gestapo; it’s ICE in unmarked vans, intelligence officials in plainclothes, and federal prosecutors operating under secretive mandates.\n\nLet’s be clear. The U.S. government has begun to systematically investigate, detain, and surveil not just undocumented immigrants or so-called “radical activists,” but mainstream journalists, television hosts, and media critics. From independent documentarians to nationally syndicated commentators, the message is chillingly consistent: any voice that challenges the regime is a national threat.\n\nEarlier this summer, Emmy-winning journalist Aida Levinson was detained for “failure to cooperate with federal investigators.” Her crime? Publishing leaked DHS memos about mass detentions along the southern border. Despite constitutional protections, she remains under gag order, her equipment seized, her legal team silenced. Her arrest was not an anomaly—it was a signal.\n\nLess than a month later, ICE initiated coordinated raids in four major cities—New York, Chicago, Seattle, and Atlanta. Their stated goal: intercept “foreign influence operations.” What they actually did was storm the offices of multiple independent newsrooms, including People’s Dispatch and The Pacific Tribune, confiscating hard drives, server backups, and source files. Several employees, including American citizens, were interrogated about their affiliations, political beliefs, and voting history.\n\nWhat’s unfolding now in the United States isn’t just repression. It’s an asymmetrical civil war—a quiet but escalating conflict between an increasingly authoritarian federal government and an informal, decentralized resistance. There are no clear battle lines. This war plays out through hacked email leaks, whistleblower subnets, encrypted journalism networks, localized street protests, and targeted boycotts. Civil society has been fragmented into nodes of resistance and compliance. Cities like Portland, Detroit, and Tucson have become pressure points, where protesters clash with militarized police, not over ideology alone, but over the very right to speak, gather, and publish.\n\nUnderground newspapers have resurged, printed with portable presses in garages and distributed in cafés and community centres like contraband. Former CIA and NSA analysts have defected into whistleblower networks, leaking documents that reveal domestic surveillance far beyond anything legal precedent permits. Anonymous collectives jam official state propaganda channels, redirecting viewers to live footage of ICE raids and suppressed court hearings. In some states, local governments have declared “constitutional sanctuaries,” refusing to enforce federal speech and surveillance laws they consider unlawful. These aren’t just political disagreements—these are tactical maneuvers in a war over reality itself.\n\nBut behind this expanding war for truth and liberty lies a more familiar, ancient force—money. And in this theatre of controlled chaos, it’s not just political operatives pulling strings. It’s billionaires, multinational corporations, and the profiteers of crisis who are reaping historic rewards.\n\nFor-profit detention facilities, some traded openly on Wall Street, have seen record-breaking revenue as the number of detainees—many of whom have never been charged with a crime—soars past any previous administration’s records. Corporations like CoreCivic and GEO Group, both major Trump donors, are billing American taxpayers billions annually to warehouse families, journalists, and political prisoners under the guise of public safety. These are not correctional facilities—they are corporate assets, run for shareholder gain.\n\nThe media landscape has been captured, not just ideologically but financially. Billionaire media moguls, protected by tax loopholes and campaign finance corruption, flood the airwaves with hatred, fear, and distraction. Their objective is simple: manufacture consent and misdirection. The louder the media shouts about immigrants, drag queens, or “Antifa infiltrators,” the less attention the public pays to the real looting—the siphoning of wealth, labour, and democracy by the billionaire class.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the same billionaires who own media outlets also hold stakes in defence contractors, data surveillance firms, and detention logistics companies. Nor is it accidental that political campaigns fuelled by the same billionaires push policies that create unrest, suspicion, and fear—conditions that justify further crackdowns and further profits. It is a self-reinforcing cycle, engineered with precision and paid for by working Americans.\n\nThe Trump administration’s repeated attacks on the media have escalated into policy. Executive Order 14221, signed quietly in June, grants federal agencies extraordinary powers to investigate “domestic propaganda threats,” a vague term that can now legally include satirists, podcasters, and whistleblowers. Add to that ICE’s new “Information Integrity Initiative,” which expands their scope to include U.S.-born citizens deemed to be spreading “destructive anti-government narratives.” The language is purposefully elastic. The targets are anyone who tells the truth.\n\nMake no mistake: this is not about immigration enforcement or border control anymore. This is about ideological purification and financial extraction. The regime is building a new enemy class—not foreign terrorists, but dissenting Americans. First-generation immigrants, naturalized citizens, Latino activists, Indigenous organizers, climate journalists—anyone who complicates the simplistic, nationalistic story that Trump and his inner circle want to sell to the frightened and the furious.\n\nThe parallels to fascist Germany are not metaphorical. They are literal. A regime under legal siege weaponizes the courts, turns border police into political enforcers, and uses the rhetoric of security to create a permission structure for tyranny. They don’t need concentration camps; they have private detention centres. They don’t need state-controlled newspapers; they have Fox, TruthSocial, and an army of tech collaborators to flood the internet with poison.\n\nThe problem is not that America has forgotten its history. The problem is that its rulers are actively rewriting it.\n\nTo every American reading this, the time to argue about “both sides” is over. If you are waiting for a clearer signal, a more dramatic headline, or a televised confession, you have already missed the train. When journalists are hunted for doing their job, when ICE becomes a domestic intelligence agency, when public dollars are used to bankroll private prisons and billionaires use cable news to pit neighbour against neighbour, the republic is no longer “under threat”—it’s already under occupation.\n\nThere is still time to resist. But not forever. In fascist states, freedom doesn’t disappear all at once. It vanishes in increments—in seizures, raids, court decisions, and executive orders—until the silence becomes too deep to disturb.\n\nRemember what the German pastor Martin Niemöller said: “Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”\n\nYou have a voice.

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "You’re Focusing on the Wrong 1%\n\nWhile millions of Americans are told daily to fear migrants crossing the southern border, the real threat to the country’s future isn’t arriving on foot — it’s flying in private jets, lobbying behind closed doors, and quietly hoarding wealth offshore.\n\nSomehow, in 2025, the “1%” has come to mean border-crossers scraping by, rather than the ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations extracting the very life from the American economy. This shift in focus didn’t happen by accident — it was engineered.\n\nThe top 1% of earners in the United States now control over 32% of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom 50% collectively own less than 3%.¹ Yet the most consistent message repeated by media talking heads and far-right politicians is that asylum seekers and undocumented workers are the cause of rising inflation, collapsing infrastructure, and unaffordable housing.\n\nIt’s a lie — and it’s dangerous.\n\nFollow the Money\n\nIn 2024 alone, over $1.4 trillion in wealth was hidden in tax havens by American corporations and billionaires, avoiding their fair share of taxes while average working families paid more in effective rates.²\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Amazon, Walmart, and ExxonMobil posted record-breaking profits — all while laying off workers, suppressing wages, and using inflation as an excuse to hike prices. Their CEOs walked away with hundreds of millions in bonuses.³\n\nYet we’re told to blame a migrant picking vegetables in California or working night shifts in a Texas warehouse.\n\nIt’s a classic bait-and-switch.\n\nManufactured Panic\n\nRight-wing media, boosted by billionaires like Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch, have poured resources into flooding public discourse with “invasion” rhetoric. Fox News, for example, mentioned “border crisis” more than 15,000 times in the first half of 2025 alone.⁴\n\nAt the same time, headlines about corruption, offshore banking leaks, or billionaire-led environmental destruction get buried — if they appear at all.\n\nWhy? Because fear keeps people distracted. And distraction keeps the status quo in place.\n\nThe Real Cost of Billionaire Power\n\nWhile states like Texas spend billions militarizing their borders and criminalizing humanitarian aid, the real looting is being done in boardrooms and financial markets. The 2023 ProPublica investigation showed that the richest Americans often pay zero federal income tax.⁵\n\nIn contrast, immigrants — documented or not — contribute over $11.7 billion annually to state and local tax revenues.⁶ Many pay into Social Security without ever claiming a benefit.\n\nThey are not the problem. They are the scapegoats.\n\nDivided for a Reason\n\nThis misdirection is no accident — it’s strategic. The ultra-rich benefit when the working class is too divided to unite. If Americans stood together — white, Black, Latino, immigrant and native-born — they might ask: Why are wages stagnant while Wall Street breaks records? Why is affordable housing evaporating while luxury condos sit empty?\n\nThey might realize that real power doesn’t cross deserts — it owns them.\n\nAnd they might finally stop pointing fingers at the poor and start pointing them at the very top.\n\nFinal Word\n\nIf you’re angry about your rent, your groceries, your health care, your kid’s future — you should be. But don’t let billionaires convince you to blame someone with less than you.\n\nThe real 1% aren’t crossing the border.\n\nThey’re already here — and they own everything.\n\nGC\n\n⸻\n\nSources:\n¹ Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Q2 2025\n² Tax Justice Network Report, July 2025\n³ SEC Earnings Filings, Q1–Q2 2025\n⁴ Media Matters Content Analysis, January–July 2025\n⁵ ProPublica: “The Secret IRS Files,” Updated 2025\n⁶ Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), 2024 Tax Report\n",

It happens through corruption and exploitation. There is no *good reason* or justification for billionaires to exist. They're a symptom of a failing system. When you see a billionaire, you see wealth that should have found its way to countless other people.\n\n2. Nobody said being in a country illegally is \"right\". It's funny how you clap back claiming \"deceitful tactics,\" but then do exactly that yourself.\n\n3. Even better, this isn't a deceitful tactic! This is *literally* an argument stating that Republicans are focused on all of the wrong issues and why it's idiotic.

They aren’t bad because it’s underfunded, it’s bad because anything you do for the “masses” is going to be worse than something privatized. It’s not rocket science. \n\nWhy do you have to “blame” something? Can’t you just take your own responsibility?",

In New York, in June, ICE officers reportedly harassed journalists covering immigration court proceedings by demanding to photograph their press credentials and falsely claiming that public areas were off-limits for reporting.\n\n&gt;In Georgia, ICE is attempting to deport journalist Mario Guevara — known for his coverage of immigration raids.  Guevara was arrested by the Doraville Police Department in Georgia while covering a “No Kings” protest against the Trump administration in the Atlanta metro area in June. He was charged with three misdemeanors and then denied bond when ICE issued a detainer against him, despite being in the country legally at the time of his arrest.  Guevara had previously left El Salvador and applied for asylum in the U.S. in 2005 after receiving death threats for his reporting.\n\n&gt;Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem publicly stated in July she is working with the Department of Justice to consider prosecuting CNN for its reporting on “ICEBlock,” a mobile app that warns users when ICE agents are nearby. Both the reporting and the app are protected under the First Amendment.\n\n&gt;These actions represent a clear pattern of intimidation designed to silence journalists and limit public accountability.",

I won't lie, I did judge a bit re: the DUI charge but I am a recovering addict so I actually do understand it. \n\nI'm commenting only because I can tell that you're driven by a need to maintain normalcy for your daughter and your family overall, but I do hope that your partner gets released and that you don't get stuck in a situation where you're in constant fear for your safety and your daughter's safety and health.\n\nSerious question though, do you live in a state where the GOP has a large presence and would you ever consider a \"blue state\" as a better fit? This isn't me laying blame or ANYTHING ELSE, I am not American and I'm simply curious if this was an option to further avoid ICE kidnapping a family member. I could be entirely wrong but if I am then I'll admit it. This is nothing but curiousity and compassion, I hope you know.",

      "text": "Sorry Not Sorry: Why ICE Agents Are Feeling the Heat in Neighbourhoods That Care\n\nIt’s hard to believe, but ICE agents are reportedly upset. Not about the pain they cause when they remove mothers from their children or deport long-time community members without warning—but because people don’t seem to like them for doing it.\n\nIn cities across North America, especially near the border, neighbours are pushing back. They’ve seen the vans roll in at dawn. They’ve watched agents knock on doors without warrants, lie about who they are, and detain people without cause. And instead of standing by, communities are standing up.\n\nThere’s growing resistance—quiet in some places, loud in others. People are forming rapid response teams, monitoring ICE activity, filming interactions, and warning others when enforcement shows up. Some are offering sanctuary. Others are blocking vehicles. Most are simply refusing to stay silent.\n\nICE may call it interference. We call it decency.\n\nEveryone knows the difference between keeping a country safe and tearing families apart. And if ICE agents are hurt that people are resisting them, maybe they should consider what side of the street they’re really on.\n\nIn the end, it’s not about feelings. It’s about justice.",

That crime was avoidable and should’ve never happened by simply enforcing laws.\n\n\n\nIt’s a pretty simple concept to understand.",

And he is not an active target per ICE. \n\n\nClinton Era (1999): Miguel Silvestre’s Deportation\n\n•  Incident Overview: In 1999, Miguel Silvestre, a U.S. citizen born in Stockton, California, was wrongfully deported to Mexico by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE claimed that Silvestre had identified himself as a Mexican citizen without legal status, an assertion he strongly denies.\n\n•  Process and Error: The deportation occurred under the expedited removal process, established by the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which allowed immigration officers to deport individuals without a hearing before an immigration judge in certain cases. In Silvestre’s case, this process led to a critical error, as his U.S. citizenship was not properly verified. The lack of a formal hearing meant there was little opportunity for him to contest the deportation or present evidence of his citizenship, such as his birth certificate.\n\n•  Impact on Silvestre: The wrongful deportation had profound effects on Silvestre. After being deported to Mexico, he faced significant challenges, including living in a country where he had no ties, as he was born and raised in the U.S. The experience caused lasting trauma, contributing to his ongoing fear of being deported again. Reports indicate that for 21 years following the incident, Silvestre avoided international travel due to concerns that he might be barred from re-entering the U.S.\n\n•  Resolution of 1999 Case: While specific details on how Silvestre returned to the U.S. after his 1999 deportation are not fully documented in available sources, he was eventually recognized as a U.S. citizen. An immigration judge issued an order affirming his citizenship, which Silvestre now carries with his birth certificate as proof to prevent future errors.\n\nTrump Era (2025): Renewed Deportation Threat\n\n•  New Incident: In 2025, Miguel Silvestre received notice from ICE indicating he was at risk of deportation again, despite his documented U.S. citizenship. This notice appears to have been related to the expedited removal process, similar to the mechanism used in 1999, suggesting a potential administrative error or misidentification.\n\n•  ICE’s Response: Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, stated that Silvestre is not currently an active target for ICE deportation.",

Now.\nThe raids are set to escalate without warning, with the full force of the National Guard and military support behind them.\nThey won’t announce it on the news. They won’t ask for permission.\nThey will simply come—for your neighbours, your co-workers, your classmates, your kin.\nAnd if we stay still—they will come for all of us.\n\nThis is not about “undocumented” people anymore. This is a campaign of fear and domination.\nThey are not enforcing law—they are enforcing obedience.\nThey are not protecting borders—they are testing how many doors they can break down before we break apart.\n\nBut hear this:\n\nWe will not break.\nWe will not bend.\nWe will not bow.\n\nThis is the moment where silence equals surrender.\nEvery ICE raid is a test of our collective courage.\nEvery raid unchallenged gives them permission to go further.\n\nSo now we act. Before they knock.\n\t•\tForm rapid response networks—tonight.\n\t•\tKnow your neighbours, your allies, your safe houses.\n\t•\tCreate emergency communication chains for your building, your street, your borough.\n\t•\tIf you hear of a raid, show up. Surround. Document. De-escalate.\n\t•\tBlock the vans. Flood the streets. Make it impossible for them to operate in secrecy.\n\nWe are not calling for chaos. We are calling for community defence.\nDisciplined, united, fearless.\n\nThey want us to feel helpless.\nBut we are not helpless.\nWe are the heartbeat of this city. We clean its hospitals, build its towers, teach its children, run its trains, cook its food.\nWe are not guests here. We are the foundation.\n\nSo let them come.\n\nLet them feel the full weight of a city that will not be conquered.\nLet them see a people who will not be moved.\nLet them realize that in trying to make us disappear, they’ve only made us visible—and unstoppable.\n\nIf they raid our homes, we will flood their streets.\nIf they take one of us, we will rise as a thousand.\nIf they strike at night, we will organize by dawn.\n\nICE is coming—at any moment.\nBut New York is ready.\n\nBlock by block. Door by door. Person by person.\nWe rise. We resist. We defend.\n\nNew York must not sleep.\nNew York must not flinch.\nNew York must rise.\n\nGC",

      "text": "They’re Chasing People Up Trees—And You’re Next If You Stay Quiet\n\nBy Grant Coleman\n\nIt sounds like something out of a bad movie, but it’s real. Right now in America, ICE agents—paid with your tax dollars—are chasing people up trees. Not terrorists. Not drug dealers. Just regular people—some of them American citizens, others parents working construction jobs, dishwashers, roofers, farmhands—being hunted like animals.\n\nWhat for? For trying to make a living. For existing.\n\nAnd while they’re getting dragged out of homes and hiding in treetops, the billionaires at the top—the ones shipping your jobs overseas, replacing you with robots, and jacking up the price of everything—are laughing. Because they know something you might not: as long as we’re fighting each other, we’re not fighting them.\n\nHere’s the truth: the richest 1% of Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 90% combined. That’s not a gap—it’s a canyon. And they’ve made sure the laws protect them, not us. CEOs get bonuses for laying you off. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Tyson break union laws every single day—but no one chases them up trees. No agents raid their boardrooms. No billionaires are deported for breaking the law.\n\nBut you know who does get punished? The guy who picks your vegetables. The woman who cleans your hotel room. The neighbour who overstayed a visa 10 years ago while working two jobs and paying taxes. In some states, they’re even deporting U.S. citizens who can’t find the paperwork fast enough to prove they’re “legal.” ICE doesn’t care. They just want numbers. Bodies. Arrests. Bonuses.\n\nAnd here’s the sick part—they’re using this chaos to bust up your rights too.\n\nThey say migrants are the problem so they can distract you from the real scam: union-busting, wage theft, and broken labour laws that go unenforced because billionaires bought off Congress. Want to know why your wages haven’t gone up in 15 years? Why you’re working more hours for less? Why your kid’s drowning in student loans while hedge fund managers pay zero taxes?\n\nIt’s not because of immigrants.\n\nIt’s because we’ve allowed the powerful to divide us while they walk away with everything.\n\nWe have to stop falling for it.\n\nThis isn’t just about migrants anymore—it’s about all of us. Every time ICE raids a job site, every time a worker gets deported instead of being allowed to join a union, they’re sending a message: we’ll punish anyone who steps out of line. And that includes you.\n\nWe need to flip the script.\n\nStart calling your members of Congress. Tell them to enforce labour laws and protect workers—not criminalize them. Demand the right to unionize without fear. Tell them to stop the deportation of people with no criminal record—people who’ve lived here for decades, paid taxes, and kept our country running while the rich got richer.\n\nBecause if they can chase one man up a tree for picking strawberries, what’s stopping them from chasing you next for asking for a raise?\n\nEnough is enough. This is our country too. And if we don’t stand up now—for each other, all of us—we may not get another chance.\n\nThe billionaires have had their turn.\n\nNow it’s ours.\n\nGC",

            "body": "Thats horrible. What's to stop trump from targeting all minorities? He'll try to get rid of the 13th and 19th amendment with an executive order. Thats step 1. Step 2 is to enforce slavery upon black people. Once that is successful they will move onto taking women out from their homes and force them into incubation farms where they become baby making machines out of their own will. Trump can do that and I can see him doing it very soon. All of this was also in project 2025. Once that is completed, they will start going after the LGBT group and start putting them into concentration camps.\n\nTrump is also going to get rid of \"black people food\" from the country. Think fried chicken, watermelon and things like kool-aide. He wants to ban all of that so the blacks can't eat it. This also means he will go after chicken and watermelon farmers effectively making them lose their job. This is also why egg prices have sky rocketed in anticipation of this ban. That's why my uncle who's a chicken farmer tried to get the word out about this and tried voting kamala. He switched professions though because it's better to be safe than sorry. Also while on the topic of Elon, I saw an article that said Elon Musk was going to start putting a melanin detector in Teslas so the blacks cant drive it, which was just unbelievable the lengths he would go to target minorities.\n\nYou think this is out of line but I say this due to when elon musk bought twitter he found out the corporate office had a cafeteria that gives employees in the office free food. He made sure to get rid of the chicken, kool-aid and watermelon from the cafeteria so that the blacks can't eat them anymore. And this was just on day 1. When I read the article that wrote this I immediately deactivated my twitter account.\n\nThis is what a fascist dlctatorship looks like.",

There are countless stories out there highlighting law abiding people being picked up and sent to other countries. I mean this was literally reported on endlessly with sending people to El Salvador with no due process.\n4. Even Trump the ultimate buffoon has admitted it’s bad enough that now he’s turning to some weird amnesty where farmers can vouch for their workers to avoid getting caught in these raids.\n\nSo back to the point: this is a massive waste of time and resources, it is not doing any better job at getting rid of the criminals as we’ve been doing in the past, and it harms communities and disrupts economies.

The fact people with no criminal records are being sent to a concentration camp that required re-using the AEA to push through tenuous removals should in itself be concerning.\n\nBut then you can go back a month before AEA was shoehorned to change existing law - and there was repeated instances of failed due process - which is the whole reason the AEA had to be used anyways. \n\n“Like Ramos, more than 50 of the men had used the government app called CBP One to make an appointment with border officials to try to enter the country. Others had crossed illegally and then surrendered to border agents, often the first step in seeking asylum in immigration court.\n\nAccording to our analysis, almost half of the men were deported even though their cases hadn’t been decided yet. More than 60 of them had pending asylum claims, including several who were only days away from a hearing where a judge could have ruled on whether they would be allowed to stay. Judges or federal officials had issued deportation orders for about 100 of the men, and a handful had even agreed to pay their own way home. Others, like Ramos, had spent their entire time in the U.S. in detention. They had no opportunity to commit crimes in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, many of those who were allowed into the country had been appearing at their court hearings and immigration check-ins. At least nine had been granted temporary protected status, which gives people from countries affected by disasters or other extraordinary conditions permission to live and work in the U.S.\n\nBy and large, these were men who had been playing by the rules of the country’s immigration system.\n\nThen, the Trump administration changed the rules”",

Step 2 is to enforce slavery upon black people. Once that is successful they will move onto taking women out from their homes and force them into incubation farms where they become baby making machines out of their own will. Trump can do that and I can see him doing it very soon. All of this was also in project 2025. Once that is completed, they will start going after the LGBT group and start putting them into concentration camps.\n\nTrump is also going to get rid of \"black people food\" from the country. Think fried chicken, watermelon and things like kool-aide. He wants to ban all of that so the blacks can't eat it. This also means he will go after chicken and watermelon farmers effectively making them lose their job. This is also why egg prices have sky rocketed in anticipation of this ban. That's why my uncle who's a chicken farmer tried to get the word out about this and tried voting kamala. He switched professions though because it's better to be safe than sorry. Also while on the topic of Elon, I saw an article that said Elon Musk was going to start putting a melanin detector in Teslas so the blacks cant drive it, which was just unbelievable the lengths he would go to target minorities.\n\nYou think this is out of line but I say this due to when elon musk bought twitter he found out the corporate office had a cafeteria that gives employees in the office free food. He made sure to get rid of the chicken, kool-aid and watermelon from the cafeteria so that the blacks can't eat them anymore. And this was just on day 1. When I read the article that wrote this I immediately deactivated my twitter account.\n\nThis is what a fascist dlctatorship looks like.",

That and other reasons. \n\nI think a large portion of the support for the conduct of ice stems from xenophobia and racism disguised as law enforcement. Laws can be changed. Lives dont have to be ruined. Immigrants have always been good for the economy. The idea that immigrants are stealing jobs is a complete lie designed to distract you from corporations and the government replacing jobs with automation and removing jobs through policy. \n\nTheres also the point that some bring up that immigrants get hired mored because they can get paid less. Sooo how about we make sure they are citizens and that there are no discriminatory pay practices? Instead of being xenophobic and kicking people to countries theyve never been in. \n\nI just dont get the mentaility of punching down when so many non-immigrant americans are in the same financial boat.

Several lawsuits have challenged this, and the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked deportations under the act, according to NPR.\n\n\n&gt;**Court Backlogs and Dismissals**: Immigration courts face a significant backlog of cases, and the administration has sought to dismiss cases to fast-track deportations. In some cases, individuals appearing for scheduled hearings have been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and placed into expedited removal proceedings, effectively bypassing the hearing they were present for. \n\nSo no, not only are they not getting a hearing, but they're getting arrested **while they attempt to immigrate the legal way**.\n\nGet your head out of Trump's ass.",

      "text": "Blood Money in Uniform: The True Cost of an ICE Paycheque\n\nICE agents in the United States earn far more than a government salary implies. Base pay starts between $55,000 to $90,000 CAD annually, depending on experience and rank. But that’s just the beginning. Hazard pay, overtime, and special locality pay can push annual earnings well past $130,000. Add in federal benefits—pension, healthcare, tuition reimbursement—and the total package is among the most lucrative in American law enforcement.\n\nBut the most alarming detail? The so-called “performance incentives.” Agents reportedly receive a $1,500 bonus for each individual they arrest or detain under immigration authority—regardless of legal status or citizenship. Yes, even American citizens mistakenly swept up in raids can count toward that quota bonus.\n\nThis structure doesn’t just reward numbers—it encourages them. More arrests mean more money. Detaining families, separating children, deporting long-term residents—it all feeds the machine. It’s not just policy enforcement anymore; it’s a pay-per-capture model where profit drives pain.\n\nICE isn’t simply enforcing laws. It’s raking in revenue off human suffering.",

In recent events ICE raids seen targeting day laborers in and around Home Depot parking lots. These raids have led to arrests, protests, and calls for boycotts of Home Depot due to the company's perceived silence on the issue. Some individuals have been arrested for filming the raids, US citizens are suing the government after being arrested while recording an ICE raid at a Home Depot. ICE agents wearing masks and not identifying themselves as and during enforcement operations. This practice is leading to increased fear and distrust, with some arguing it undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and creates an environment of intimidation. Killing of farm workers and US citizens go missing. This is precisely the actions of the Nazi's secret police force that played a crucial role in Germany's internal security during the rise of Germany right wing government 1930's .",

So, go read up on your American history. If getting paid a substandard to do jobs which Americans don't want to do, plus not getting any benefits from those jobs, if that's modern-day slavery, I don't know what it is. I don't know where you got  \"Magats\" love slavery since they all for deporting illegals and making Americans work again.

Look up for the actual policies and how they shifted. Here’s a shortened version https://www.studentsofhistory.com/ideologies-flip-Democratic-Republican-parties\n\nModern day republicans are the democrats of the past, which you so much despise. \n\nAs to maga loving slavery or not, I’ve seen quite a lot of republican farmers outcry since their cheap labor got deported. No Americans want those jobs.\nThe problem is not in deportations, but how they’re done. \n\nAnd another point is that is you concern is if you concern is to give americans more jobs, then what kind of jobs are you talking about? basic manufacturing? Mining coal? Picking crops? Most of these should be automated. People should develop and improve their skills to produce better and more advanced products. Otherwise you are competing with China, who have no labor protection and child labour. Their products are cheap, you won’t be able to export your goods that have much higher labour costs, because they are not competitive. To be competitive you need better technology, with that you’d have more high paying jobs. There must be more regulations to make sure the profits from increased productivity are not concentrated in the hands of the super rich. And republicans are clearly unfit to deliver on this.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "ICE Is Detaining U.S. Citizens—Because They’re Brown, Poor, and Politically Inconvenient\n\nIn 2025, under Donald Trump’s second term, ICE has not only survived criticism—it has expanded into one of the most aggressive and unchecked federal agencies in the country. Despite past public outrage, its core mission has shifted even further from immigration enforcement toward racialized political suppression.\n\nThe facts are clear: ICE continues to illegally detain U.S. citizens, overwhelmingly targeting Black, Brown, and Indigenous people who speak out against the regime or simply “look undocumented.” Civil rights lawyers, watchdog groups, and investigative journalists have documented a disturbing rise in wrongful detentions since 2021, many of which intensified following Trump’s reelection in 2024 and the quiet repeal of internal review protocols designed to prevent citizen detentions.\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases in early 2025 involved Jameelah Rivera, a Puerto Rican community organizer from Florida, who was taken into ICE custody after speaking at a protest against voter suppression. Despite showing proof of her U.S. citizenship—including her birth certificate and driver’s license—she was detained for nine days, interrogated without legal counsel, and released only after public pressure went viral. ICE gave no apology.\n\nThe systemic nature of these abuses was confirmed in a March 2025 report by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which found that ICE wrongfully detained at least 76 U.S. citizens in 2024 alone—more than double the number in 2022. In nearly all cases, the victims were either racialized, lacked financial resources to access immediate legal defense, or had public records of political dissent.\n\nAn internal DHS memo leaked in April 2025 revealed a chilling directive: “Use all available resources to verify identity post-detainment if initial indicators suggest risk to national cohesion.” Translation: arrest first, check facts later. And if you’re Black, Latino, Muslim, or Indigenous, “risk” includes simply existing with an accent, protesting publicly, or having an undocumented family member.\n\nEven more disturbingly, advocacy groups have flagged ICE’s increasing collaboration with local law enforcement in Republican-controlled states to create “preemptive watchlists” of community activists, leftist organizers, and immigration lawyers. These individuals report being surveilled, harassed at borders, and subjected to secondary screenings without warrants or justification.\n\nThe Biden-era safeguards—such as the Sensitive Locations policy and enhanced oversight through DHS’s Office for Civil Rights—were quietly dismantled in the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. Meanwhile, ICE’s 2025 budget reached an all-time high, surpassing $10 billion, with significant increases earmarked for digital surveillance, facial recognition databases, and “mobile detention capacity.”\n\nDespite court rulings reasserting the constitutional rights of all citizens, ICE continues to operate in legal limbo, protected by politicized judges, Trump-loyal state governors, and a federal government increasingly hostile to dissent.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about immigration anymore. It’s about power. It’s about fear. And in 2025, it’s about silencing Americans who don’t fit into a whitewashed vision of what being “American” looks like.\n\nThey’re not deporting undocumented migrants.\nThey’re deporting citizens.\nAnd they’re doing it because they can.\n\nGC",

The word stupid  is unnecessary.\nThe short version of my long drawn out poor grammar previous statement is that everybody is saying the US citizen was arrested because of the color of his skin. When in fact, he was taken into custody because he did a criminal act by puncturing the tires of the ice agent’s vehicles. It just always seems anytime somebody gets arrested. Who is anything other than White? It always appears that it has to be some kind of racist or Hatred for that person’s due to his or her color.  No\nOne ever wants to believe that it’s possible that a non white person might be getting arrested for some kind of wrong doing.  That is a very small minded way of thinking. Most of the time ,not always but most of the time people of any color including white are being arrested for breaking the law. \nShocking ! I know right?",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Theory: Why ICE Agents Dress Like American Grunt-Style White Supremacists – My Personal Analysis \n\nLet’s just call it what it is: federal cosplay. ICE agents wearing grunt-style tactical gear—skull insignias, Punisher logos, wraparound Oakleys, and all-black everything—isn’t about professionalism or safety. It’s about projecting fear. It’s about aligning themselves, visually and ideologically, with a cultural aesthetic that’s been long hijacked by white supremacists, paramilitary militia groups, and those who believe in the purity of borders more than the value of human life.\n\nMy theory, this isn’t accidental. It’s a uniformed signal. The state, bloated with nationalism and slipping into authoritarianism under the guise of “security,” adopts the aesthetic of the fringe to slowly normalize it. ICE isn’t just a border enforcement agency anymore—it’s the frontline of a new American identity. One that no longer wears badges with humility but with dominion. One that trades in blue uniforms and procedural language for combat boots and the language of “us versus them.” The “them” being the immigrant, the refugee, the undocumented—the scapegoat.\n\nWhen ICE agents dress like Three Percenters or Proud Boys, it blurs the line between official government authority and civilian extremism. It tells the public, especially marginalized communities, that the people coming through your door aren’t here to help—they’re here to conquer. It’s shock and awe dressed up as law enforcement.\n\nYou see it creeping across state lines too. Local sheriffs start wearing tactical gear on routine calls. Border patrol units start talking like they’re soldiers in an ideological war. Even private security companies mirror the same look—one that screams: we’re not protecting you, we’re preparing for war.\n\nAnd war is exactly the point. A silent, creeping one. A psychological occupation of public space by an empire more concerned with optics than ethics. The dystopia isn’t in the future. It’s stitched into the patch on the shoulder of a man kicking in someone’s door at 3AM, covered in tactical gear made for a battlefield, not a neighbourhood.\n\nThis isn’t just militarization—it’s cultural signalling. It’s about building loyalty among those who believe America belongs to a specific kind of person. White. Armed. Fearful. And it’s about intimidation. Showing the rest of us that resistance isn’t just futile—it’s already surrounded, surveilled, and dressed for a purge.\n\nIn the end, it’s not just about what they wear. It’s about what they want to become. A regime where ideology replaces law. Where ICE becomes less of an acronym and more of a warning: In Case of Emergency… enforce nationalism.\n\nGC",

People of all races wear them where I live, especially former military. Some of them hate the current administration and the way things are going in this country but they still love their country and several of those type of t shirt companies give part of their earnings to veteran aid groups. People complaining about profiling people are the same ones calling everyday normal citizens white supremacists based on how they look. Just because someone has a shaved head, wears a cowboy hat and boots or runs around naked doesn’t make them a white supremacist anymore than a T-shirt does. If someone was to say that a Mexican with tattoos wearing a plain white oversized T-shirt and khaki shorts made them a gang member it would be considered racist.  This is no better.

      "title": "Myanmar: This is how protesters deal with Law enforcement attempting to break up peaceful demonstrations! ( This is how you take on ICE )",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Since a military coup took over Myanmar in early 2021, the people there have been standing up to their country’s army in ways that are smart, tough, and deeply courageous. The military kicked out the elected government and took full control, thinking people would fall in line. But instead, they lit a fire of resistance that still burns strong today.\n\nAt first, millions of regular people hit the streets to protest peacefully. But when the military started beating, jailing, and even killing protesters, many decided enough was enough. Now, a new kind of fight is happening. People have formed local defence groups, kind of like community militias, and some have teamed up with older rebel groups that have been fighting the army for years. Together, they’ve turned into a powerful force in certain parts of the country.\n\nThis isn’t just a war with guns. It’s also a battle of ideas, technology, and everyday life. Young people especially are using phones, apps, and social media to spread the truth about what’s happening. They record videos, organize protests, and reach out to the world, even though the army tries hard to shut them down.\n\nWorkers all across Myanmar—nurses, teachers, government staff—have joined a massive strike. They’ve walked off the job to make it harder for the military to run the country. This movement, called the Civil Disobedience Movement, is one of the main ways the people are fighting back without violence. It’s causing major problems for the generals in charge.\n\nThe army has responded with brutal violence—burning villages, arresting kids, and killing thousands. But instead of scaring people into silence, it’s making them more determined to take their country back. More and more people are joining the fight every day.\n\nThe people of Myanmar don’t just want new leaders—they want a whole new system where the army doesn’t control everything. This is bigger than just politics. It’s about freedom, dignity, and the right to decide their own future.\n\nAs Canadians and Americans watching from the outside, it’s easy to feel like this is far away. But what’s happening in Myanmar shows what can happen when people come together to stand up to a corrupt system. It also shows the limits of what our governments are doing to help. Sanctions and speeches aren’t enough. The people of Myanmar are asking to be seen, heard, and supported in real ways.\n\nThis fight isn’t over. And against all odds, the people—many of them farmers, students, and workers—are still standing. \n\nThey believe they can win. \n\nAnd maybe we should too.\n\nGC",

You can watch daily video of rebel attacks on junta forces here on reddit. They started out with handmade weapons and single shot hunting shotguns but are now armed with military weaponry including artillery, rpgs and zu-23 anti-air. It's quite amazing how regular everyday civilians banded together and kill literally all the governments loyal people in the countryside and hold a large part of the country. It seems like a well armed police force has power until they're overwhelmed with superior number and have no community support.",

But American cops would never approach such a dense resistance, rather they advance through scattered protesters after and during a barrage of”non-lethals.”  HOWEVER, defend against the barrage, get closeup, make them forcibly remove the protest and the conversation changes.\n\nResisting the barrage…  the shields are garbage against swords 🤔 but they could deflect non-lethal munitions 🤗 and hide whatever maneuvering is happening behind 🤩.  \n\nNetting could also work, like a gladiator’s net that snarls the enemy’s weapon.  A net could also be thrown over a riot shield and pulled forward.\n\nCould plow-shaped shields be deployed on the ground, pushed forward by teams to undercut riot shields and footing?  It’d be a way to push back against their shield wall, obviously non-lethal, giving no pretext for escalating lethality.  What else?",

They're rounding up people who have green cards and have been complying with their court dates and immigration meetings. Some are even actually American brown people swept up in these raids. If you're okay with American citizens being roughed up and thrown in jail until somebody's willing to look at their ID, because of the color of their skin, then you can go ahead and fuck off. That's not America. Not from this century anyway, and we won't go back ✊🏽🇺🇸🇵🇸❤️#FreePalestine while we're at it too!",

Every time it happens, it is a civil rights violation that is going to end up getting the government sued every time, which means we are all going to pay for those judgments against the government. All because the objectives of the raids aren't just to round up \"Illegals\", it's also to cause fear and division. It's part of the fascist takeover playbook. How do you prove you're a citizen when you don't get due process?\nJust like how reports indicate that at least one US citizen, George Retes, an Army veteran, was detained for three days at \"Alligator Alcatraz\". How the fuck did he get all the way to the Florida concentration camp from California before they checked to see who they had? And then they just released him in Florida with nothing. That's just plain kidnapping a US citizen! And just like I don't want American citizens in cages or anybody in cages, I don't want innocent people being bombed in another country, using my tax dollars to do it. So yes, Free Palestine, Fuck Israel, DEATH, DEATH to the IOF!!!",

      "title": "America‘s Cold Civil War and Canada - ICE a big factor in the crisis",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "America’s Cold Civil War Is Heating Up — And Canada Is Getting Pulled In\n\nRight now, the United States is a country on edge. It’s divided like never before, not just between everyday people, but inside its own government, police, military, and national guard. President Donald Trump is in his second term, and the country looks less like a democracy and more like a powder keg waiting to blow.\n\nThis isn’t just political bickering anymore. What’s happening in America looks a lot like the early stages of a civil war. Not with tanks and battles yet, but with bitter divisions, armed groups, and parts of the government refusing to follow orders. And if things keep going the way they are, that cold war could turn hot — fast.\n\nAmerica at War With Itself\n\nIn many parts of the U.S., armed militia groups loyal to Trump are training, organizing, and even preparing for violence. Meanwhile, ICE agents are rounding people up and deporting them in record numbers. Police in some cities are openly siding with these far-right groups. In other places, the National Guard is ignoring the President’s orders. It’s chaos.\n\nPeople on both sides of the political spectrum are protesting daily. The far right is shouting about conspiracies and trying to shut down the government, while the left is pushing back against what they see as a dictatorship in the making. It’s not just about politics anymore. It’s about survival, identity, and who controls the future.\n\nCanada: Distracted and Drifting\n\nWhile this all plays out down south, most Canadians are glued to their screens watching it unfold. But while we’re distracted by the U.S., something dangerous is happening at home.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney, with help from both the Liberals and Conservatives, quietly pushed through Bills C2 and C5. These bills give even more power to big corporations and lobbyists, and strip away protections for workers and unions. They passed with barely any media attention because everyone was too focused on what was happening in America.\n\nAnd just like that, Canada took a big step closer to being controlled by the rich and powerful — with barely a word from the public.\n\nThe truth is, the Liberals and Conservatives are working together to help corporations, not average people. And without a strong NDP or real workers’ party to push back, working Canadians are getting left behind. Wages aren’t keeping up, public services are being cut, and the cost of living keeps rising. Meanwhile, corporations and the wealthy keep getting tax breaks.\n\nFar-Right Ideas Spreading North\n\nWhat’s even more concerning is how fast far-right, American-style politics are spreading into Canada. Groups in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and even Ontario are now working directly with U.S. militia groups. They share videos, fundraising tools, and even plans for protests and disruptions. Some of these groups are now training in the woods just like their American partners.\n\nWe can’t pretend it’s just an American problem anymore. The same anger, fear, and misinformation are taking root here, too.\n\nWars Abroad, Cuts at Home\n\nOn top of all this, the U.S. is getting ready for new wars overseas. Tensions are rising with China, Iran, and in Eastern Europe. If any of those turn into a real conflict, the U.S. will expect Canada to help — with money, soldiers, and support.\n\nBut neither country is ready for war. Both the U.S. and Canada are already cutting spending on healthcare, housing, and education. But at the same time, they’re handing out big contracts and tax breaks to defence companies, oil companies, and billionaires. The rich win again, and regular people are told to tighten their belts.\n\nA Worldwide Problem\n\nIt’s not just Canada and the U.S. Governments all over Europe are doing the same thing — helping the rich while working people fall further behind. In places like France, Germany, and the UK, far-right and nationalist parties are gaining ground because regular people are sick of being ignored and left behind. Even places known for fairness, like Scandinavia, are feeling the pressure.\n\nThis global system is broken. Regular people are doing all the work, but it’s the corporations and the wealthy who keep getting ahead. That’s why so many are angry, fed up, and losing faith in democracy.\n\nTime to Wake Up\n\nThe United States is tearing itself apart. And while that happens, our own leaders are quietly helping the rich while telling workers to wait their turn. This is a wake-up call.\n\nDo we sit back and hope things get better, or do we stand up and fight for a future where working people come first? We need to rebuild real political power for workers — not just the NDP, but a movement that actually speaks for everyday Canadians.\n\nThe road ahead is a dangerous one if we don’t collectively act.\n\nGC",

      "title": "America on the Verge of Collapse - ICE and Detention facilities in swamps are just one part of a deteriorating Empire",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "Is America on the Verge of Collapse ?\n\nI recently read a couple of books by Ray Dalio. One being “The Changing World Order “ , and the other being “Why Empires Fall”. So ,for fun , I tried to give a layman’s breakdown of what I read. I also included a short video clip I found online , which seems to closely resemble my thoughts after digesting the material .\n\nRay Dalio, one of the “allegedly” smartest investors in the world, laid out six warning signs that show when an empire, like Rome or the British Empire, is collapsing. The scary part? As of right now, the United States seems to have already hit five out of six. And it seems like it’s close to hitting the last one. \n\nHere’s what that looks like in plain terms from my “non-expert” perspective .\n\n 1. Too Much Debt and Money Printing\n\nThe U.S. government owes over $36 trillion. To keep things going, it keeps printing more money, making the dollar worth less and driving up prices for everyone. Wages aren’t keeping up, and regular people are paying the price.\n\n 2. Fighting from Within\n\nAmerica isn’t united anymore. People are divided by politics, race, religion, and class. Millions of people protested in June alone ( over 6 million from what I’ve read and seen on TV). Red states and blue states act like enemies. Social media is full of hate and fear, not facts or solutions.\n\n 3. Weak Leaders and Loud Populists\n\nThere’s no one in charge who can calm things down. Instead, you’ve got billionaires, influencers, and corrupt politicians (who appear to be on the take from corporations ) yelling the loudest and stirring the pot. Trump’s back in the spotlight in his second yet not consecutive term , and guys like Elon Musk act like they run the country. Probably not now as he’s turned on Trump because he didn’t get his Electric Vehicle Rebate promise from the administration . ( I don’t believe for a second Elon cares about America’s debt and deficit - but that’s just me). \n\n 4. Broken Justice System\n\nA lot of Americans don’t trust the courts or police anymore. The justice system is being used as a weapon—depending on who you are, you either get crushed or walk free. The law doesn’t feel fair or equal.\n\n 5. Falling Behind in Education and Work\n\nWhile other countries are training engineers like India at a 10-1 rate and building the future, the U.S. is stuck fighting over school books, banning teachers, and building detention facilities in swamp lands. Kids are drowning in student debt, and trades aren’t getting the respect or support they need. Meanwhile, China and India are leaving the U.S. in the dust.\n\n 6. Losing Power to Other Countries (Almost There)\n\nThis is the final step, and it seems it’s getting close. Countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are trading with each other without using the U.S. dollar. If the dollar loses its place as the world’s main currency, America could face a financial crisis like we’ve never seen. If something major happens, like a war over Taiwan, the U.S. might not be able to handle it.\n\nNone of this is about being left or right. It’s about seeing the writing on the wall. I say this as a Canadian who cares—what happens to America affects us all. The U.S. is heading down the same road as every great empire that collapsed before it.\n\nIf you’re even paying a little bit of attention to what is happening, and you don’t exclusively rely on CNN or FOX or any media owned by billionaire’s who hire millionaires to tell us the news, you can cleary see the system is cracking. \n\nIt’s probably not too late for the American people to stop it , but the clock is ticking and man oh man does it feel like it’s close to midnight.\n\nThe next national protest is scheduled for August the 2nd , and America will need more than 6 million protesters. Huge peaceful protests garnering over 3.5% of the population have a psychological rallying effect that can turn close elections. It’s the same as a political rally , except on a grand scale , which will have an impact on the midterms in every close race , assuming elections still exist. Why do you think that whoever is in charge , whether it’s Republicans or Democrats , they use law enforcement to disrupt and antagonize normally peaceful people? It’s to intimidate the participants and those who dare to join them. It’s also used to make it appear the protesters are violent by focussing on smaller groups of protesters or when the protests are thinning out when they’re over, making it appear on mainstream media that the effort is hopeless. ( It also exposes how scared the governing party is of its own people).\n\nI guess I’m rooting for democracy because if America falls, so does Canada, Europe , and potentially all democracies worldwide.\n\nGC",

They don't exist in the way you mean that they do.\n\nThe Schengen area is not an open border for immigration; It is an open border for travel by citizens of member countries. The schengen areas still have strict point of entry and external border controls; They just don't control their internal borders. The EU's Schengen area is identical to Canada, Mexico, and the US's state/provincial borders. There is no need to provide a passport to travel between states and provinces, and immigration controls exist at external ports of entry. If Europe's internal border control reduction is leading to increased illegal immigration within Europe in aggregate, no nation on the planet should allow free travel between states or provinces, or any kind of locally controlled travel / shipping enforcement. The EU has simply confederated external border control; Similar to how the US has federalized it, and how Canada and Mexico have nationalized it.\n\nCanada does not have an open border. They have a very rigorous immigration program that is highly selective and helps prepare immigrants for adapting to life in Canada. They provide services to new immigrants who meet country-specific requirements to assist them in immigrating so that immigration does not create an exploitable underclass within Canada, and does not worsen poverty. However, this is an up-front cost that is offset by just a few years of taxes paid by immigrants in qualified employment programs. Over the lifetime to an immigrant who qualifies for settlement in Canada, they will almost certainly provide enough revenue to offset the costs that the Canadian government takes to aid immigrants in adjustment by at least one order of magnitude.\n\nFrankly, there are a lot of people spreading extremely unhinged takes about what's happening in Europe, and have been for decades. Just because the headline is repeated on sites that aren't the Daily Stormer doesn't mean it isn't a neo-Nazi talking point.\n\n\\--I'm an American that is in the process of emigrating to Canada. It's not an easy, or cheap thing to do. And I applaud Canada taking in Ukranian refugees and bumping them in front of me in line, because it's just a damn reasonable and humane thing to do.",

Btw I have online Canadian friends who I’ve been friends with for years and that’s not what’s happening over in Canada, Canada may have border laws just like the US like you said but apparently Trudeau didn’t bother to in-force them. Many European nations allow migrants from many middle eastern countries to come in no questions asked and they immediately give them aid and that’s what their Citizens don’t like. Those people are not there to work or make the country better, in fact many have been on Government aid for over a decade by now and never want to work or help the Country instead they just bleed the country dry while the Citizens who need help don’t get any. Look at Italy and Spain, they’re being basically overrun by Migrants who go in and commit crimes, authorities do nothing and the citizens have finally had enough of it. This very same app has hundreds of videos and news headlines of what’s happening there. The citizens are going against their own authorities in protest because those subhumans keep rapping young girls and the authorities do nothing. Look at Sweden, during the Syria collapse they allowed millions of them to come in, because they wanted that cultural enrichment and now, they’re given them $30K to leave 😂 Educate yourself on what’s really happening and why they’re happening buddy. You applaud Canada because you don’t live there but the citizens there don’t because they’re taking opportunities from them and they’re not receiving assistance like foreigners are. You bet, you wouldn’t feel the same if someone was given the job you so badly wanted just because they were foreigners. Also get Ukraine cock out of your mouth do a 5 minute research in to why they’re at war and how their soldiers literally wear Nazi insignias.",

And now he’s pro Mena and anti U.S. oil production. As usual, he’s hawking a version of the world where empires decline, while building a fortune of more than 14B, all while he invests rediculous amounts of really insanely rich peoples money (he just opened two offices in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, the Saudi one right on the heels of the Trump trade deal with them). He’s not exactly “one of us” and has much to gain from pushing this narrative, and is implementing that gain.\n\nI love how everyone complains about how billionaires are ruining everything, but lap up whatever they offer without critical thought if it fits their personal ideological driven doomerism narrative.\n\nThere is a whole genre of people who publish theories like this - Ray just got a *ton* of traction on his YouTube videos as they “fit the moment” for people looking for an explanation.\n\nHe’s no different than  Mancur Olson’s *Rise and Decline of Nations* which is also a good read. \n\nOr Joseph Tainter’s *The Collapse of Complex Societies*, which lines up similar theories.\n\nOf course all of these build on Strauss and Howe’s great book *The Fourth Turning*, which is the granddaddy of them all in terms of cyclical explanations.\n\nDo read these other books, and look more deeply than just Ray Dalio. He could be right. I’m not arguing he isn’t. But I would encourage people to get a *lot* more educated before buying hook, line and sinker into his philosophy and messages.",

If you don’t think large scale migration has anything to do with societal collapse then keep studying. I’m not saying it’s all that but it’s a major contributing factor. As for who has been ruining the country inside and out the past ten years, the democrats take the cake. Republicans aren’t great either but the Democratic Party had their foot on the gas pedal of dismantle America. It’s practically been their slogan",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "To the Soul of a Nation: A Message of Love, Defiance, and Unbreakable Hope to the American People\n\nTo my American brothers and sisters,\n\nI’m writing this to you not just as a Canadian, but as someone who sees what’s happening and refuses to stay silent. What you’re going through isn’t just politics. It’s something much deeper. Something historic. The world is watching, and many of us are standing right beside you, even if we’re across a border.\n\nLet it be known: the first chapter of this fight was written in June, when a record six million Americans stood up across the country in peaceful protest. You showed the world that the spirit of the people is still alive. And now, the next chapter is coming—August 2, 2025—when you will rise again to stop fascism, to fight for justice, and to remind the rich and powerful that this country does not belong to them. It belongs to you.\n\nMore and more experts are saying what many of you already feel in your gut: the United States is already in a kind of civil war—a cold one for now, but with real danger of turning hot. Scholars like Dr. Barbara Walter, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Timothy Snyder, and Noam Chomsky have all warned that your democracy is cracking under the weight of lies, corruption, and corporate greed. People are being locked up. Truth is being twisted. Wages are flat while prices skyrocket. You’re working harder, getting less, and still being blamed for the mess the billionaires made.\n\nIt’s not just bad policy. It’s a war on working people.\n\nAt the top are the ones pulling the strings. Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Larry Fink—these guys have more money and power than some governments. They’re using it to take over everything: elections, media, transportation, the internet, even your personal data. Companies like Amazon, Meta, Palantir, BlackRock, Vanguard, and JPMorgan Chase don’t care about people—they care about control. They want to keep you struggling, distracted, and divided while they rake in billions.\n\nThey want to replace democracy with profit. And they’re almost there.\n\nBut here’s the truth: they’re scared. Not of your anger. But of your love. Of your unity. Of your belief in each other.\n\nThis is why the Resistance matters. This is why August 2nd matters. This isn’t about going back to some fake golden age. It’s about building a future that works—for all of us. Where billionaires don’t write the rules. Where your kids can afford to live. Where work means dignity, not debt.\n\nIf the American people win this fight, the world changes. You’ll be able to force global organizations like the United Nations to hold the rich accountable with real taxes. You’ll shut down the loopholes that let billionaires hoard wealth while working families go without. You’ll show the world that the people still have power.\n\nSo don’t give up. Don’t get distracted. Don’t let them divide you. The Resistance isn’t some group—it’s you. It’s every worker who says enough is enough. Every neighbour who helps a stranger. Every person who refuses to let fear win.\n\nLet August 2nd be the day the tide turns.\n\nWith love, fire, and unshakable hope,\n\nGC",

Many of us are trained to use a firearm for food and self-defense. \n\nI live in Oregon, and Oregon is not a \"Stand Your Ground\" state in the same way as some other states with explicit laws. However, Oregon does not require individuals to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense. The state's self-defense laws, particularly ORS 161.219, allow the use of deadly force if a person reasonably believes another person is using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force. This means that while Oregon doesn't have a specific \"Stand Your Ground\" law, the legal framework effectively provides similar protections. I know that Washington has a similar and even more liberal self defense law. \n\nAdditionally, All 50 states have some form of Castle Doctrine, which allows individuals to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves or others within their homes or other legally occupied spaces, without a duty to retreat. While the specifics of how the doctrine is applied vary by state, the core principle of protecting oneself from intruders or attackers remains consistent. ",

There were no visas, no quotas, no waiting lists for most of them. People simply arrived at ports like Ellis Island, underwent brief inspections for health or criminal background, and were often admitted the same day. That was the “legal way” then *because the law* made it relatively easy.\n\nBefore 1924, when the U.S. implemented strict national origin quotas, millions of Europeans came with little bureaucratic interference. The Immigration and Nationality Act as we know it today didn’t exist until 1952. So, if your grandparents came before the mid-20th century, they likely didn’t need a visa at all, and the concept of “illegal” immigration, at least for white Europeans, was largely irrelevant.\n\nMeanwhile, today’s immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia all face many legal obstacles. There are limited visas, long backlogs, and high denial rates, even for those seeking to flee violence or reunite with family. Saying “there is a legal way” ignores that, for many modern migrants, the system is functionally closed. *unless you have 5 milly*\n\nBasically my point is this. The legal process in this country when your grandparents came was a *bridge* but if they tried today it would be a *barrier*. You are ignoring the context and if you studied history you would be able to see that better.",

Now millions of line/fence jumpers are paying the price for their actions.  Legal immigrants are thriving in America right now.  If you pay attention to the ICE Raids, more than 50% of the ICE officers are legal immigrants.  God willing, He'll aid these brave ICE agents, and they'll clean up American streets where children can once again play unaccompanied in the streets.  Once all the illegal aliens are deported, we'll be able to scrutinize every legal immigrant application and only allow the hard workers to become American citizens.

Usually right when they show up for their scheduled documentation check-ins. These ARE the people “doing it the right way.”  \n\nAnyway, when they are gone, your grocery stores are empty, your garbage isn’t getting picked up, and the $15B a year they pay in taxes are gone (without being eligible to receive services back), let’s check back in and see how you’re feeling then.",

Once their immigration case gets denied because asylum is always temporary, they need to go back home.  \n\nDo you really think grocery stores will be empty, garbage will be piled up, and commerce will halt because illegal aliens are no longer leeching off our society?  We'll save billions not funding their lifestyles while most of these assholes get paid under the table and dont pay taxes.  Please come back to reality.  God forbid you will have to do manual labor.  Can't a woman do any job a man can?  I think so.  I'll even tie my garbage up for you so it doesn't fly all over the street like so many illegal aliens litter on our streets.  They treat our beautiful country like the shithole they came from.  Just because they live in a garbage pile and litter in their home country doesnt mean they can come here and do the same.\n\nFinally, Americans are seeing these deplorable for what they actual are gangsters, terrorists, murderers and rapists.  Its a small price to pay for Americans to start driving produce safely on our highways again.  Everything will be safer and you won't have to worry about being raped or murdered like all the Laken Rielys out there.",

Normally they want some fear to keep the illegal aliens controlled, but with ICE actually doing their job now these companies are having to cut their \"Investments\". Oh, but idiots on reddit who think they're fighting to save the illegal aliens are in reality fighting to keep them in chains so they can get their McDonald's staffed. \"We cannot get rid of the illegal immigrants because who will serve our coffee then?\" Is the most common reason I've found why redditards support illegal immigration. It's racist af and is genuine modern day slavery in the US. It's actually disgustingly inhumane and makes me sick, especially when redditards on here support children being kidnapped so cartel criminals can come in posing as \"fathers\".\n\nTbh ICE isn't going far enough. Arrest the people incentivizing illegal immigration in business as well, or at least fine businesses $3000 for every day every illegal alien they knowingly let work for them. Corpos would drop illegal aliens so fucking fast you would see a genuine decrease in illegal immigration.",

      "title": "The Dawn of a Cold Civil War in the USA - ICE and other issues the cause",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "The Dawn of a Cold Civil War in the United States: Deportation, Wealth Transfer, and the Rise of State Violence\n\nThis is a prediction I never wished would come true!\n\nThe United States no longer teeters on the edge of internal conflict—it has stepped into it. This is not a war of flags and secessions, but a cold civil war, waged in courtrooms, on city streets, and through financial policy. The evidence is neither metaphorical nor hypothetical: it is visible in the tear gas, the detention camps, the dismantling of civil liberties, and the historic redistribution of public wealth to private capital.\n\n1. Deportations and Disappearances: The Machinery of Exclusion\n\nDeportations have surpassed 139,000 this year alone, extending not only to undocumented persons, but increasingly to permanent residents, asylum-seekers, and, disturbingly, U.S. citizens misidentified or targeted due to political dissent. ICE, now operating as a semi-autonomous enforcement entity, has repeatedly refused to produce warrants or identify officers during removals, especially in sanctuary cities. This has led to widespread legal challenges, though federal judges increasingly defer to national security justifications.\n\nBut the most alarming trend: U.S. citizens—journalists, union organisers, student leaders—are being detained, surveilled, or charged under pretexts such as “material support to disorder,” despite non-violent behaviour. Dissent has become cause for prosecution; ideology is grounds for surveillance.\n\n2. Violence from Above: The State’s Armoured Response\n\nThe distinction between policing and military engagement has collapsed. The National Guard, local police, ICE, and in some cases active-duty military personnel have been deployed in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, and Chicago—not for natural disaster relief, but to confront protests and “protect” federal assets from what the administration calls “subversive civil elements.”\n\nProtesters—many peaceful, some armed with only shields and protective gear—have been fired upon with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and flash-bang grenades. In multiple verified incidents, medics and legal observers were beaten or arrested without provocation. Military-grade surveillance drones monitor movements over entire city blocks.\n\nPhysical violence is no longer incidental—it is strategic. It is meant to paralyse dissent, intimidate, and provoke chaos. In a now-viral video, ICE agents in unmarked tactical gear tackled a mother in front of her child while bystanders screamed for a warrant that was never shown. No names were given. No jurisdiction admitted.\n\n3. The Pushback: Defenders and Protesters Fight Back\n\nThe population has not remained passive. Across the nation, protesters and ordinary civilians are now physically intervening when ICE agents or National Guard troops arrive in communities. In Portland, a crowd of demonstrators formed a human wall to block access to an apartment ICE agents were raiding. In the Bronx, an unarmed man was arrested after shielding an elderly neighbour from an ICE takedown. The footage, now seen over 10 million times, shows him shouting, “Show me a warrant!”—a demand ignored.\n\nIn several cities, physical altercations have occurred between protesters and state forces, leading to fractured limbs, mass arrests, and a growing list of civilian casualties. The situation has created a feedback loop of violence: the more resistance rises, the more justification is given for increased state repression.\n\n4. Economic Warfare: Funding the War Against the Public\n\nAt the same time, tax and fiscal policy have been weaponized against the lower and middle classes. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” is not just a legislative oddity—it is a blueprint for economic domination. By allocating over $170 billion to enforcement agencies and military contractors, while simultaneously cutting essential services, benefits, and subsidies, the federal government has created a two-tier society.\n\nThe rich are insulated, subsidised, and protected. Everyone else is subjected to economic extraction, surveillance, or both. Analysts across political science, economics, and law agree: this is no longer capitalism—it is feudal enforcement under constitutional pretence.\n\n5. Urban Ground Zeroes: New York and Los Angeles\n\nUrban centres are under siege. In New York, ICE has targeted Latinx neighbourhoods while the NYPD patrols protest routes with drones and mounted officers. In Los Angeles, protesters describe waking up to the sounds of helicopters and armoured personnel carriers on their blocks. Community centres and libraries have been raided under anti-terrorism statutes. Warrants are vague or nonexistent. Lawyers often arrive too late.\n\nSchools in LA and Queens have hired private security to keep federal agents away from students. Churches and mosques have become sanctuaries again—just as they were during the last immigration crackdown two decades ago. But this time, even these spaces are not safe. Reports of ICE entering places of worship without cause have triggered legal alarms at the ACLU, but appeals languish in politicised federal courts.\n\n6. When Citizens Become Enemies\n\nA new threshold has been crossed: bona fide U.S. citizens are now being targeted not for criminal acts but for political beliefs, protest participation, and attempts to defend others. If citizenship no longer protects you from surveillance, harassment, or detainment, then it no longer functions as a social contract. Citizenship has become conditional: tied not to law or birthright, but to compliance.\n\nThis is the heart of the cold civil war. Its violence is not total, but strategic. Its goal is not conquest, but compliance. It produces no battlefields, but many prisons.\n\n7. A Nation Repressing Itself\n\nThe emerging consensus among political scientists, sociologists, and historians is unanimous: the United States is undergoing a systemic internal conflict, driven by wealth consolidation, ideological cleansing, and militarised enforcement. Projections of civil strife based on inequality indices have doubled since 2010. Trust in institutions—Congress, the courts, the press—has collapsed to levels not seen since Watergate.\n\nTo call this a cold civil war is not an act of sensationalism—it is a reflection of present reality. The pushback is real. The resistance is active. But the repression is state-sponsored, publicly funded, and no longer constrained by law or decency.\n\n8. Conclusion: A Warning and a Reckoning\n\nThe future remains unwritten, but the present is brutally clear: violence from the state is no longer restrained. Protesters defending their communities are being attacked. ICE no longer recognises judicial authority. The military appears domestically more often than diplomatically. Wealth is pulled upward while justice is buried.\n\nThis is not a nation in turmoil. It is a nation at war with itself.\n\nThe only remaining question is whether Americans will reclaim the republic before it becomes fully irretrievable—or whether the silent war will harden into something far worse.\n\nGC",

They are now the young hardcore MAGA types and [Groypers (actual literal Nazis btw)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groypers) who are shaping the political landscape we see today. \n\nAll that was left was to find a label by which they could universally dismiss the concerns of everybody who isn't white, Christian, capitalist and heterosexual. They tried with CRT, they tried for YEARS with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, but they finally struck gold with [the word \"Woke\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke). \n\nThey were successfully able to misconstrue the spreading of awareness of the dark (pun intended) parts of history with a malicious intent against all whites. Enough people believed this that the MAGA kkkult was able to sink its claws into a generation of lonely disaffected young men and the rest is modern history. \n\nBy the time they were mainstream with the shit, so much soft work had already gone into normalizing these sentiments that liberals could no longer see anything wrong with the blatant statement of intent to [suspend the rules of the Constitution ](https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1599042348670799872?t=G1o3teuBbkd-FOTJ-E5IcA&amp;s=19). \n\nBut if I call them a Nazi I'm hysterical. \n\nIt's really the perfect gaslight but I don't mind if people think I'm crazy who would go along with this clown shit.",

The Expedited Removal Act created in 1996, by a DEMOCRAT named Bill Clinton.  This Act has been followed by EVERY President since then.   \n\nIMMIGRATION falls under the EXECUTIVE BRANCH of Government.  Ice asking you for your papers is DUE PROCESS under this act!  \n\nIllegally Immigrants who work for $lave labor are what drives down equal wages for Citizens and jobs.  So I guess DEMOCRATS are in support of $lave wages and low wages for Americans. \n\nLand:  We bought the land from Mexico and cleared up debt they owed. \n\nOverstayed Visas:  Are Illegal.\n\nLaws are suggestions.  Even if you think crossing the boarder illegally is a misdemeanor.  \n\nIsn't it a shame that we as a country need to add this type of money to a bill because the former administration left the gate open for 4 years letting everyone and anyone in.  I mean there are other ways we could be spending this money.  \n\nOh yeah and the comment about tax cuts for the rich.  I'm pretty sure you are employed by a rich person.  Imagine telling them they need to pay more......mind you 10% of the top are paying 78% of the personal income tax in this country.  They'll leave /'s take there money and your job with them.  READ THE BILL It's actually written in pretty basic English!  \n\nYou democrats cry about everything -  Roe V Wade- you've had control over the house and senate and could of made changes.  YOU DIDNT but cried about it when someone did.  Same thing about birthright citizenship \n\nRepublicans aren't empathetic.....You have dem trolls on Facebook posting videos saying those poor girls in TX got what they got because their parents voted for Trump!  \n\nOffended by everything \nAshamed of nothing \nEntitled to everything \nContributing nothing \n\nI don't want to hear any democratic BS Becasue I won't respond to your insults and ignorant ideology!",

As of two days ago, after participating in the propaganda by not fact-checking false information that they participated in spreading, the 50501 Movement has removed their affiliation with this initial posted video. This kind of disinformation is dangerous to communities affected as Trump has already made claims this weekend that Ice Agents are “under daily violent assault”, and horseshit like this just encourages his small mind and inflames his followers.\n\nLet the MAGA meatheads drone on about how you just wait until ICE shows up with 50,000 more poorly-trained racist bullies afraid to show their faces and you'll be sorry. \n\nYes, we will.

But not in the way you’re painting it.\n\nAmericans are tired of the constant outrage, the half-truths, and the emotionally charged claims that fall apart under basic scrutiny. This idea that ICE is “kidnapping” people or that this administration is operating illegally doesn’t line up with how the system actually works.\n\nHere’s the reality: Donald Trump won the 2024 election. He took the Electoral College and for the first time in two decades for a Republican won the popular vote. That result didn’t come from social media noise or media manipulation. It came from tens of millions of voters, across party lines, deciding they were done with chaos, open borders, and ideological games. You don’t have to like it, but it happened and it wasn’t close.\n\nAs for immigration enforcement, ICE operates under laws passed by Congress, some of which were written and signed by Democratic administrations. The authority for expedited removals and deportations isn’t new, and it’s not unique to this administration. Courts have stepped in where needed, yes, but that’s what they’re there for. That’s not evidence of tyranny; that’s evidence of a functioning legal system.\n\nThe people being removed? Most have criminal records, prior deportations, or violated immigration law. That’s not some fringe talking point that’s DHS data. Are there exceptions? Of course. No system is perfect. But spinning isolated cases into a national crisis is dishonest at best.\n\nSo no, enforcing long-standing immigration law isn’t grounds for civil war. It’s not fascism. It’s not even new. What is new is this bizarre idea that laws only matter when your side is in power.\n\nAnd here's the thing, finding out the truth doesn’t take much. You don’t need to trust me. Spend five minutes checking public DHS reports, read actual court rulings, or look at raw data from sites like congress.gov, uscis.gov, cato.org, or pewresearch.org. Even Reuters and AP will give you straight reporting when you cut through the opinion fluff. And if that isn't enough,copy this post and fact check the information with any AI service.\n\nThe facts are out there. You just have to want to find them.",

They are lawfully snatching up illegal aliens on parole .\n\nLook at the title of the OP: ... Americans on how they FEEL..\n\nWhat’s been violated primarily are our feelings, our sense of justice, our moral standards - not the law.\n\nAnd we also know that when those things come into play, bias in reporting goes through the roof.\n\nMost recently at a pot farm raid, there were paragraphs on how many people got hurt, and the kinds of weapons ICE used, and the type of military vehicles used. And then only one little sentence about how a protestor FIRED A GUN AT ICE! Well, injuries and smoke grenades start to make sense, when the correct context is provided.\n\nWhen we look at the whole point of this subreddit, escalation by law enforcement makes perfect sense, too. ICE has to protect itself from violent protesters to do their job.\n\nThis whole thing is a shitshow. But I stand by the fact it’s our own fault. Because we didn’t enforce our own laws previously. Now we’re wrecking peoples lives to enforce perfectly humane laws we have on the books.\n\nWhat we need now, more than anything, are laws to humanely deal with this temporary situation we’ve created.\n\nThat’s not done by confronting ICE; it’s done by confronting our Congressional representatives.",

      "text": "ICE arresting American Citizen’s \n\nThey warned us about creeping authoritarianism—this is what it looks like. \n\nICE, an agency originally designed for immigration enforcement, is now detaining American citizens on U.S. soil for exercising constitutional rights: filming in public spaces, asking questions, and refusing to be silent.\n\nThis isn’t a border issue anymore—it’s a civil liberties crisis. These agents, increasingly shielded by legal grey zones and executive overreach, are testing the limits of the law and pushing far beyond them. As of July 2025, there are documented cases of American citizens with birth certificates being unlawfully detained, sometimes for days, without charges. Just for challenging authority with a camera.\n\nWhen a government agency begins treating its own citizens like foreign threats for simply speaking up, that’s not law enforcement—it’s control. Watch the video. Then ask yourself: how many more rights are they willing to take before we push back?\n\nGC",

      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "The Numbers Don’t Lie: ICE Raids Are Fuelled by Fear, Not Facts—While Corporate Exploitation Goes Unpunished\n\nLet’s be clear: the so-called “immigration crisis” in the United States is not rooted in border insecurity—it’s rooted in economic exploitation. The true crime isn’t undocumented workers—it’s the corporations and individuals who knowingly profit from underpaying, overworking, and threatening them.\n\nEvery undocumented immigrant working a “slave-wage” job is not doing so because they want to undermine the labour market—but because the system has been engineered to exploit them. These workers pick the produce, build the homes, and clean the offices for the very same elites who bankroll politicians railing against their presence.\n\nICE raids don’t target exploitative CEOs or businesses violating labour law—they target the most vulnerable people in the workforce, many of whom have no criminal record and whose only “offence” is working for wages that no citizen could survive on. Over 11,700 people with no criminal record have been detained so far in 2025, a 1,271% increase. Meanwhile, employers who violate minimum wage laws, safety regulations, or engage in wage theft face negligible risk of prosecution.\n\nThis isn’t enforcement—it’s a smokescreen. The real deterrent to exploitative labour practices isn’t border militarization. It’s enforcing living wages, ensuring the right to unionize, and criminally prosecuting employers who rely on illegal labour precisely because it is defenceless.\n\nIf we truly wanted to stop this cycle, we wouldn’t be sending ICE agents into homes and factories—we’d be sending labour inspectors and prosecutors into corporate boardrooms.\n\nIt’s time to stop blaming the people exploited by this system, and start blaming those who built it, profit from it, and maintain it through silence, lobbying, and legislative sabotage.\n\nUntil every worker has the right to fair pay, safe conditions, and collective bargaining—regardless of immigration status—this is not a democracy. It’s a market dictatorship, and it runs on fear, not freedom.\n\nGC",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",

      "text": "The Corporate Media Blackout and the Quiet Start of America’s Second Civil War\n\nOn June 14, 2025, over five million Americans marched in the largest protest in U.S. history. The “No Kings” movement rose up in 2,100 cities, demanding an end to Trump’s authoritarian crackdowns, ICE raids, and military deployments in places like Los Angeles and Seattle.\n\nBut if you watched the news, you barely saw a word. Instead of reporting on the scale of peaceful resistance, corporate media—owned by billionaires backing the current regime—focused on isolated fires and “looting.” They ignored the flash bangs, rubber bullets, and federal troops used against unarmed citizens.\n\nThis blackout isn’t accidental. America’s mainstream media now serves power, not truth. And what they’re hiding is chilling: the federalisation of the National Guard, Marines used to disperse protests, and citizens kidnapped off the street. These are not border operations—they are the early mechanics of martial law.\n\nThis is the slow roll of fascism.\n\nAnd Canadians should care deeply.\n\nWhen a country with 330 million people begins to collapse into civil conflict, Canada cannot remain untouched. Our economies, borders, families, and futures are interlinked. Refugees, supply chains, and even militarised spillover will reach us. If democracy falls in America, Canadian democracy becomes more vulnerable, too.\n\nWe can’t look away. This isn’t a U.S. domestic issue—it’s a continental emergency.\n\nSo don’t wait for the nightly news. Watch the livestreams. Talk to people on the ground. And remember: if they can silence millions, they can silence you.\n\nGC",

I'm not sure if businesses realize that ICE cannot trespass you business without a search warrant. You can make an invaluable difference by simply locking your doors and manually letting people in. If ICE were to come, you could deny their entry if they don't produce a search warrant that specifically targets your location. If they have a warrant, by law you need to let them in, but ICE and their bounty hunters currently are opportunistically walking into wide open businesses to question anyone and everyone in the business. You can be that first line of defense against illegal searches and seizures for your community.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "To My American Friends: You’re Being Set Up Again—This Time with Iran\n\nAs a Canadian, I’ve seen this movie before.\nIn 2003, the United States was told Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction. That Saddam Hussein was tied to terrorism. That war was necessary to keep the world safe.\nNone of it was true.\n\nAnd here’s the part that rarely gets talked about: Israel played a major role in selling that lie.\n\nIsraeli intelligence and political leadership—especially Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu—pushed the narrative that Iraq was a threat to Israel and the broader West. Their claims were echoed by U.S. neoconservatives, many with deep ties to Israeli interests.\nSome of the “evidence” came directly from Israeli intelligence—much of it unverified or deliberately distorted.\nThat helped launch a war that cost trillions and destabilized the Middle East for decades.\n\nCanada refused to join that war. And we were right.\n\nNow It’s 2025. Same Strategy. Different Country.\n\nThis time it’s Iran. And once again, Israel is leading the charge.\n\nFor over 30 years, Israeli officials have claimed Iran is “two months away” from building a nuclear bomb.\nThey said it in 1996. In 2005. In 2011. And again in 2023.\nThirty years of “two months away.”\nIt was never true. It’s still not true.\n\nNow, in 2025, Israel is making the same claim—again.\nAnd yet, U.S. intelligence has told Congress: Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Israel. They launched massive airstrikes across Iran—targeting research facilities, energy plants, air defences, and even civilian infrastructure.\n\nAnd now they’re pressuring the U.S. to escalate.\nTrump says, “I may do it. I may not.”\nWe’ve seen this exact setup before.\n\nIsrael builds the narrative. The U.S. is expected to fight the war. The American public is lied to—again.\n\nWho Profits? Not You\n\n • Defence corporations like Lockheed Martin, RTX (Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, and L3Harris saw their stock values jump after the bombing began.\n\n • Executives and shareholders are cashing in—while the rest of the country is paying more for food, gas, and rent.\n\n • RTX is spending $37 billion on stock buybacks while ordinary Americans are struggling to afford healthcare and housing.\n\nThis war isn’t about democracy or defence.\nIt’s about money—and control.\n\nWhy Now?\n\nBecause America is facing serious unrest:\n\n • Mass protests are growing across the country.\n\n • ICE just arrested an elected Democrat inside a New York courthouse—without a warrant.\n\n • Journalists are being stalked.\n\n • Protesters are being labelled “extremists.”\n\n • State-level crackdowns are expanding while national attention is deliberately diverted.\n\nIt’s not a coincidence.\n\nAuthoritarian governments manufacture foreign wars to silence internal rebellion.\n\nThis isn’t about Iran.\nIt’s about keeping the American public distracted, divided, and afraid—while elites lock in power at home.\n\nCanada Is Saying No—Again\n\nWe didn’t follow you into Iraq. We won’t follow you into Iran.\n\nWe won’t be part of another war manufactured under false pretences, influenced by foreign lobbying, and designed to benefit weapons manufacturers and oligarchs.\n\nTo every working American:\nYou are being set up. Again.\nDon’t fall for it. Don’t fight for it. Don’t fund it.\n\nSay no—before it’s too late.\n\nGC\n",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "ICE Raids in America —You Have the Right to Defend Yourself—Even in the Face of Authority\n\nLet’s get something straight: in the United States , no one—not even a government agent—has the lawful right to seize you without showing you valid identification or a warrant. If someone attempts to detain or remove you without cause, authority, or transparency, that’s not law enforcement—that’s kidnapping. And under both natural law and constitutional principles, you are entitled to defend yourself.\n\nSo What Are Your Rights?\n\n 1. Fourth Amendment – Unreasonable Search and Seizure:\n\nThe U.S. Constitution protects you from being detained or searched without probable cause and legal process (like a warrant signed by a judge). If someone claims to be law enforcement, but they refuse to identify themselves or fail to present a warrant, their actions have no lawful standing.\n\n 2. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments – Due Process:\n\nYou are entitled to fair legal procedures before the state can take away your liberty. If that process is skipped—if they come at you in unmarked vehicles, no ID, no warrant, and no explanation—that’s not due process. That’s an abduction.\n\n 3. Self-Defence Laws (varies by state but generally consistent):\n\nNearly every state in the U.S. recognizes your right to use proportional force to protect yourself from unlawful harm. That includes the right to defend against illegal restraint or abduction—especially when you have reason to believe your life or safety is in imminent danger.\n\n 4. Citizens’ Rights to Intervene:\n\nIf you witness someone being grabbed by unknown individuals—especially if they refuse to identify themselves or show legal cause—you have both a moral and legal precedent (in many jurisdictions) to intervene or call for help. This isn’t just good citizenship—it’s basic human decency backed by law.\n\nThe Rule Is Simple: No ID + No Warrant = No Authority\n\nIf a stranger grabs your arm, shoves you into a car, and refuses to say who they are or why they’re doing it, they’re not law enforcement—they’re a kidnapper, no matter what badge they might flash after the fact.\n\nReal law enforcement:\n\n • Shows their ID when asked.\n\n • Presents a warrant when detaining someone.\n\n • Explains the reason for the stop or arrest.\n\nIf they don’t? They are not operating within the law. And the law doesn’t grant them any special protection when they break it.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\n • Ask firmly and clearly for ID and a warrant.\n\n • Yell “I don’t consent!” and “Help! I’m being kidnapped!” to alert bystanders.\n\n • Record if you can.\n\n • Resist using reasonable force if you genuinely believe your life is in danger and the person is not lawful authority.\n\n • Call 911 or shout for others to do so, even if you suspect the kidnappers are agents—they must follow legal protocols.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nNo law, no badge, no institution has the right to disappear you off the street without process. Your rights are not suggestions. They are the hard-won pillars of every free society. The minute someone acts outside them, you’re not resisting authority—you’re resisting tyranny.\n\nWhether you’re in jeans and steel-toes or a three-piece suit, those rights are yours. Use them. Protect them. And protect each other.\n\nGC",

        "body": "A situation becomes a possible threat when individuals attempting to detain you lack clear identification, refuse to state their authority or agency, and don't follow standard legal arrest procedures. If they appear in plain clothes, in an unmarked vehicle, and try to force you without explanation or a visible warrant, a reasonable person might perceive this as an unlawful abduction or kidnapping. In such scenarios, if you genuinely and reasonably believe you are facing a criminal act rather than a lawful detention, proportionate self-defense could be justifiable.\n\nConversely, it is an arrest when uniformed officers, clearly displaying badges or identifying themselves as law enforcement (e.g., ICE, police), state their authority and attempt to detain you. Even if you believe the arrest is unjust, or if you're subject to expedited removal, physical resistance is generally not warranted. In these cases, your rights involve remaining silent, asking for a lawyer, and challenging the arrest or detention legally through the proper channels, rather than through physical confrontation.",

That is, if they are actually just bounty-hunters with patches, or proud boys, or whatever and not full-fledged government agents.\n\nWith that said, if they are actually government agents, even acting unlawfully, they can fuck you up with almost guaranteed impunity.  Derek Chauvin is the exception, not the rule.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The harder we make it for them to take people, the better off we all are.  We have to wear them down and make them hate what they do.  If someone grabs me without making a real convincing argument for why they have that right, I'm going to resist. Fucking with a kid? I will take the beating that's going to come.  But I recognize that they will probably win the argument in court after they gang up on me.\n\nLet me end by saying \"fuck ICE\".",

Or maybe they'll kill her if she becomes too much trouble or they get bored and want something new. Does this qualify as \"imprisonment\"? Does her legal status matter? Or only US citizen can fight back and is protected against crime, but kidnapping and raping a person not authorized to be in the US is just a fun time? \n\n2/ they are ICE but the person is in the US with legal status or has been given some temporary legal status. Or the person has greencard or is US citizen. Detain them cause them inconvenience to say the least. Last I check, this is the US, not North Korea or Russia. We don't allow secret police going around making people disappeared. Do you want to be pushed down to the ground or cuffed for hours while you're on your way to get coffee before work because your skin isn't white enough?\n\n3/ they are ICE and this person is not in the US with legal status. They saw a robbery and a US citizen was killed. They are the only witness and they can identify the killer.  ICE has already shipped this witness off to who knows where. What if the murder victim happens to be related to you or someone you know, and now the killer can go free, you good with this?\n\n4/ nothing on the news, but noone ever hears from this person again. Friends and relatives post missing person. Is this not a kidnapping regardless of status?",

Being to lazy to do the legal steps should be okay because laziness is what brings yall together? Cuz add as dumb as that sounds. It's no dumber than people who lost the vote being such little bitches that they throw hilarious sissy hissy fits over illegals that knowingly broke in,  but hey you all don't go inviting them into your house since you love them so much.  Go ahead n make them spare house keys.  Cmon stand on that embarrassingly dumb shit you guys are talking.  Or if one breaks into your house like they broke in the country,  don't call the cops or get mad,  go on the news,  give your address,  and invite more people to break in,  tell them they can even stay,  they don't gotta run off,  cuz you got their backs huh? 😆😆 right? Hell yea,  you don't look n sound so stupid that your great grand kids are gonna be so embarrassed/ ashamed if they ever hear this waste of breathe of a pov you're repping that they'll change their last name😂😂 go ahead,  keep us laughing and respond,  tell me how this is incorrect.

        "body": "ICE Raids in America —You Have the Right to Defend Yourself—Even in the Face of Authority\n\nLet’s get something straight: in the United States , no one—not even a government agent—has the lawful right to seize you without showing you valid identification or a warrant. If someone attempts to detain or remove you without cause, authority, or transparency, that’s not law enforcement—that’s kidnapping. And under both natural law and constitutional principles, you are entitled to defend yourself.\n\nSo What Are Your Rights?\n\n1. Fourth Amendment – Unreasonable Search and Seizure:\n\nThe U.S. Constitution protects you from being detained or searched without probable cause and legal process (like a warrant signed by a judge). If someone claims to be law enforcement, but they refuse to identify themselves or fail to present a warrant, their actions have no lawful standing.\n\n2. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments – Due Process:\n\nYou are entitled to fair legal procedures before the state can take away your liberty. If that process is skipped—if they come at you in unmarked vehicles, no ID, no warrant, and no explanation—that’s not due process. That’s an abduction.\n\n3. Self-Defence Laws (varies by state but generally consistent):\n\nNearly every state in the U.S. recognizes your right to use proportional force to protect yourself from unlawful harm. That includes the right to defend against illegal restraint or abduction—especially when you have reason to believe your life or safety is in imminent danger.\n\n4. Citizens’ Rights to Intervene:\n\nIf you witness someone being grabbed by unknown individuals—especially if they refuse to identify themselves or show legal cause—you have both a moral and legal precedent (in many jurisdictions) to intervene or call for help. This isn’t just good citizenship—it’s basic human decency backed by law.\n\nThe Rule Is Simple: No ID + No Warrant = No Authority\n\nIf a stranger grabs your arm, shoves you into a car, and refuses to say who they are or why they’re doing it, they’re not law enforcement—they’re a kidnapper, no matter what badge they might flash after the fact.\n\nReal law enforcement:\n\n• Shows their ID when asked.\n\n• Presents a warrant when detaining someone.\n\n• Explains the reason for the stop or arrest.\n\nIf they don’t? They are not operating within the law. And the law doesn’t grant them any special protection when they break it.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\n• Ask firmly and clearly for ID and a warrant.\n\n• Yell “I don’t consent!” and “Help! I’m being kidnapped!” to alert bystanders.\n\n• Record if you can.\n\n• Resist using reasonable force if you genuinely believe your life is in danger and the person is not lawful authority.\n\n• Call 911 or shout for others to do so, even if you suspect the kidnappers are agents—they must follow legal protocols.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nNo law, no badge, no institution has the right to disappear you off the street without process. Your rights are not suggestions. They are the hard-won pillars of every free society. The minute someone acts outside them, you’re not resisting authority—you’re resisting tyranny.\n\nWhether you’re in jeans and steel-toes or a three-piece suit, those rights are yours. Use them. Protect them. And protect each other.\n\nGC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nkzo1bxlf7f1.jpeg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac283879f7f2dba8fbf65b1d855a7abdf749ad3b",

Local/county/state law enforcement often make warrantless arrests. Do you really believe that if a police officer gets dispatched to a domestic abuse call, that they have to wait for a warrant to be issued prior to affecting an arrest? If you do, then you show your ignorance. The same principle applies. I’m sure you respond and claim, “Well, ICE arrests are different”. They are, but the same principle applies.\nLaw enforcement, including ICE, does not have to identify themselves to bystanders! They can, of course. They most certainly do not have to show an ID.\nThe vast majority of ICE arrests will never have a judicial warrant, as they are administrative in nature, not criminal.\nWhen ICE arrests a person &amp; charges them with an immigration violation, they receive due-process in Immigration Court (and the Board of Immigration Appeals, upon appeal). A person does not receive their due-process prior to being arrested.\nICE arrests are not “illegal restraint or abduction”. \nYour claim that there is a “moral and legal precedent to intervene with an ICE arrest, and then claim that this so-called “legal precedent (in many jurisdictions)” shows that you are clueless as to federalism works. The Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution ensures that federal law applies, not the laws of some other jurisdiction. \nYour lack of knowledge of these matters is going to get someone hurt, or worse.\nYou are not helping people, despite what you believe.",

        "body": "ICE Raids in America —You Have the Right to Defend Yourself—Even in the Face of Authority\n\nLet’s get something straight: in the United States , no one—not even a government agent—has the lawful right to seize you without showing you valid identification or a warrant. If someone attempts to detain or remove you without cause, authority, or transparency, that’s not law enforcement—that’s kidnapping. And under both natural law and constitutional principles, you are entitled to defend yourself.\n\nSo What Are Your Rights?\n\n 1. Fourth Amendment – Unreasonable Search and Seizure:\n\nThe U.S. Constitution protects you from being detained or searched without probable cause and legal process (like a warrant signed by a judge). If someone claims to be law enforcement, but they refuse to identify themselves or fail to present a warrant, their actions have no lawful standing.\n\n 2. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments – Due Process:\n\nYou are entitled to fair legal procedures before the state can take away your liberty. If that process is skipped—if they come at you in unmarked vehicles, no ID, no warrant, and no explanation—that’s not due process. That’s an abduction.\n\n 3. Self-Defence Laws (varies by state but generally consistent):\n\nNearly every state in the U.S. recognizes your right to use proportional force to protect yourself from unlawful harm. That includes the right to defend against illegal restraint or abduction—especially when you have reason to believe your life or safety is in imminent danger.\n\n 4. Citizens’ Rights to Intervene:\n\nIf you witness someone being grabbed by unknown individuals—especially if they refuse to identify themselves or show legal cause—you have both a moral and legal precedent (in many jurisdictions) to intervene or call for help. This isn’t just good citizenship—it’s basic human decency backed by law.\n\nThe Rule Is Simple: No ID + No Warrant = No Authority\n\nIf a stranger grabs your arm, shoves you into a car, and refuses to say who they are or why they’re doing it, they’re not law enforcement—they’re a kidnapper, no matter what badge they might flash after the fact.\n\nReal law enforcement:\n\n • Shows their ID when asked.\n\n • Presents a warrant when detaining someone.\n\n • Explains the reason for the stop or arrest.\n\nIf they don’t? They are not operating within the law. And the law doesn’t grant them any special protection when they break it.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\n • Ask firmly and clearly for ID and a warrant.\n\n • Yell “I don’t consent!” and “Help! I’m being kidnapped!” to alert bystanders.\n\n • Record if you can.\n\n • Resist using reasonable force if you genuinely believe your life is in danger and the person is not lawful authority.\n\n • Call 911 or shout for others to do so, even if you suspect the kidnappers are agents—they must follow legal protocols.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nNo law, no badge, no institution has the right to disappear you off the street without process. Your rights are not suggestions. They are the hard-won pillars of every free society. The minute someone acts outside them, you’re not resisting authority—you’re resisting tyranny.\n\nWhether you’re in jeans and steel-toes or a three-piece suit, those rights are yours. Use them. Protect them. And protect each other.\n\nGC",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "A Canadian’s Warning: June 14, 2025 — The Day You Take Your Country Back\n\nI’m not American. I’m a Canadian who loves my country, watches yours closely, and knows what happens when democracies fall apart. And I’m telling you: if you don’t stand up now, you might not get another chance.\n\nWhat’s happening in the United States right now under Donald Trump’s second term isn’t just politics—it’s a dangerous game. I’ve studied how civil wars and dictatorships begin. I’ve looked at what happened in Germany in the 1930s, in Chile in the 1970s, and in Russia more recently. And I see Trump following the same script.\n\nHere’s the pattern:\n\t1.\tCreate chaos.\n\t2.\tCall every problem a crisis.\n\t3.\tBlame someone else—immigrants, liberals, protesters.\n\t4.\tUse fear to grab power.\n\t5.\tBreak the rules that keep leaders in check.\n\nSince returning to office in January 2025, Trump has declared a never-ending “emergency” at the southern border. ICE is arresting people in cities like Los Angeles without warrants or trials. Peaceful protesters are being treated like enemies of the state. Trump is calling everything—from immigration to free speech—some kind of “invasion” or “revolution,” just so he can bring in troops, bypass the courts, and rule without anyone stopping him.\n\nHe says it’s about protecting America. But history shows that leaders who do this are never protecting their people—they’re protecting themselves.\n\nIt happened before. Hitler said he had to take emergency powers “just for a while.” He never gave them back. Trump is doing the same thing. He’s stacking the system so no one can tell him no—not Congress, not the courts, not the people.\n\nBut this time, the story isn’t over yet. You can stop it.\n\nThat’s why June 14, 2025 matters. It can be the day Americans say, “No more.” Not just by protesting—but by refusing to play along. By speaking out. By standing together. By supporting workers, lawyers, journalists, teachers, veterans—everyone who is trying to hold the line. By overwhelming this corrupt system with truth, with courage, and with action.\n\nSome say it’s too late. I don’t believe that.\n\nEven if things get worse—even if Trump pushes the country into a weird kind of civil war with red states versus blue cities, or tries to jail his critics or silence the press—the people can still win. It’s been done before. In Poland. In South Africa. In the U.S. civil rights movement. When regular people stood up and refused to go along with injustice, they changed everything.\n\nYou don’t have to fight with violence. You have to fight with truth, unity, and guts.\n\nDon’t wait for someone else to save you. Don’t hope the system fixes itself. Trump has already broken too much. The courts are being ignored. The police are being used as tools. The military is on standby. And every time the people protest, Trump calls it an “insurrection”—not because it is, but because he wants a reason to crush it.\n\nThis is fascism. Plain and simple. And if you’ve ever wondered what you would’ve done in 1930s Germany or 1960s Alabama or 1980s Chile—this is it. This is your moment.\n\nFrom the north, we’re watching. From history, we’re warning you.\n\nJune 14 can be the beginning of the end of Trump’s power grab. But only if you make it so.\n\nStand up. Speak out. Show up. Don’t let this be the year America gave up. Let it be the year you took it back.\n\nGC",

      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "American ICE Apprehensions, Detentions , and Deportations : Did you know that ICE, in many cases, is acting illegally?\n\nUnder the second Trump administration, ICE operations—particularly in California and specifically Los Angeles—have intensified, often in ways that contravene both constitutional protections and federal case law. It is imperative to distinguish between lawful immigration enforcement and apprehensions that violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, federal immigration statutes, and due process.\n\n1. Warrantless Arrests Without Probable Cause:\n\nICE agents routinely conduct apprehensions without judicial warrants, relying instead on administrative warrants (I-200 and I-205), which do not confer the same legal authority as warrants issued by Article III courts. This is especially unlawful when used to enter private residences without explicit consent or judicial authorisation, per United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez and Illinois v. Rodriguez.\n\n2. Racial Profiling and Arbitrary Stops:\n\nNumerous incidents reported since May 2025 in L.A. suggest patterns of racial profiling, with ICE officers targeting individuals based solely on ethnicity or accent. This practice violates the Equal Protection Clause and runs afoul of Flores v. Reno and Whren v. United States, which affirm that race alone cannot justify investigative stops.\n\n3. Detaining Legal Residents and Asylum Seekers:\n\nApprehensions of individuals with valid Temporary Protected Status (TPS), asylum claims in progress, DACA coverage (pending judicial review), or pending visa petitions constitute violations of both the Immigration and Nationality Act and Zadvydas v. Davis, which restrict indefinite detention and guarantee procedural due process.\n\n4. Sanctuary Jurisdiction Overreach:\n\nICE raids carried out within sanctuary jurisdictions without coordination with local law enforcement or municipal judicial authorities violate Tenth Amendment protections and may breach Printz v. United States, which limits federal commandeering of state agencies.\n\n5. Failure to Provide Due Process and Access to Counsel:\n\nMany detainees are being transferred to remote private facilities without timely access to legal counsel, in contravention of the Sixth Amendment and the standards set forth in Padilla v. Kentucky, which affirm the right of non-citizens to informed legal representation in deportation contexts.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese patterns indicate a strategic bypassing of constitutional safeguards, which render many ICE apprehensions as currently practised not merely unethical but unambiguously illegal. Courts have repeatedly upheld that immigration enforcement must respect constitutional rights; administrative convenience or executive policy cannot supersede the rule of law. The ongoing ICE operations in June 2025 risk significant legal liability and civil rights violations.\n\nGC",

That’s cute. The U.S. legal system doesn’t run on imagination, Karen. It runs on the Constitution, and guess what? Even non-citizens have rights under it. Shocking, I know—next you’ll be learning the Earth isn’t flat and pineapple on pizza isn’t a war crime.\n\nNon-citizens, including undocumented migrants and asylum seekers absolutely have rights to due process, legal counsel, and fair treatment under the law. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments don’t start with “only if you were born here” — they say “no person” shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process. That includes the mom fleeing cartel violence, the dad trying to reunite with his kids, and yes, even the guy waiting in line for his court date while ICE tries to play whack-a-migrant.\n\nAs for “start reporting facts not opinions” — great advice! You should try it sometime. The fact is, due process doesn’t disappear the moment someone crosses a border. If it did, you’d have government agents deciding guilt by vibes alone, and buddy, if that ever happens, it won’t just be migrants on the chopping block—it’ll be you too when someone doesn’t like the look of your bumper sticker.\n\nSo until then, leave the legal analysis to people who don’t get their news from angry YouTube thumbnails.",

Thus, there is no Judicial involvement in an administrative arrest. ICE needs reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, to question a person. \n\nNo evidence has been provided that ICE is racially profiling. It is allegation made without proof. Now, it may well happen, but I prefer to see evidence rather than claims.\n\nArresting people with TPS, asylum application, DACA, or pending visa petitions is permissible. A person with current TPS who commits a crime can have TPS terminated. Also, many TPS designations have been terminated by this administration; having an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) with an expiry date in the future is moot - the EAD becomes invalidated when the TPS is terminated. An Asylum application does not convey any immigration status, nor does a pending Visa petitions. DACS recipients have deferred protection from deportation &amp; that is currently under Judicial review; DACA, can also be revoked for criminal conviction. The Zadvydas decision is not relevant, as that case pertained to individual in extended INS/ICE custody where their country of citizenship would not issue travel documents needed for deportation.\n\nICE is not required to notify local law enforcement that they will be operating in a particular jurisdiction (though, they often do). ICE does not “commandeer” state agencies. \n\nDue process is received at Immigration Court, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upon an appeal. ICE is a nationwide agency &amp; regularly moves detained persons to facilities away from the arrested persons locality. ICE detainees are permitted to use telephones to contact their attorneys. Attorneys are not assigned to detainees, as these are not criminal proceedings and they are not entitled to an attorney at government expense; a detainee can hire an attorney at their own expense.",

            "body": "Ah yes, the legalese salad tossed with a side of half-truths and “technically correct” takes, hoping you won’t notice the dressing is pure gaslighting. Let’s take this apart, piece by piece, with facts as of June 14, 2025:\n\n\nCLAIM: “ICE doesn’t need a warrant to arrest people; arrests are administrative, not criminal.”\n\nFACT CHECK:\nYes, ICE can conduct administrative arrests under immigration law, but the Constitution still applies. The 4th Amendment doesn’t vanish just because DHS decides to call it “administrative.” Courts have repeatedly ruled that entering a home without a warrant or consent violates constitutional rights, even for immigration enforcement (see United States v. Martinez-Fuerte and multiple 2023–2024 federal rulings reinforcing that).\n\nAlso, increasing numbers of ICE operations have been blocked or challenged due to unlawful entry and coercive tactics, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions. ICE’s “we don’t need a warrant” line only works outside your home, and only with reasonable suspicion—which brings us to:\n\nCLAIM: “ICE only needs reasonable suspicion and there’s no proof of racial profiling.”\n\nFACT CHECK:\nFalse on both counts.\n\n\t1.\tQuestioning requires reasonable suspicion, yes—but arresting someone requires probable cause under 8 CFR § 287.8(b)(2), which has been confirmed by both the BIA and federal courts.\n\n\t2.\tAs for racial profiling? You must’ve slept through 2024. A Stanford-CUNY joint study, released in late 2024, reviewed bodycam and arrest records across 5 states. It found that Latino and Black residents were stopped by ICE at more than 3x the rate of white individuals in mixed-status communities—with false-positive detentions disproportionately affecting U.S. citizens of colour.\n\nThe ACLU and several immigrant advocacy groups have documented dozens of cases in 2023–2025 where ICE agents admitted targeting based on “accent” or “appearance.” That’s not speculation. That’s evidence.\n\nCLAIM: “Arresting people with TPS, asylum applications, DACA, or pending visas is legally allowed.”\n\nFACT CHECK:\nYes, technically—but you’re ignoring both policy and judicial constraints.\n\n\t•\tTPS can be revoked for crime—but revoking it based on petty misdemeanours or accusations (not convictions) is being legally challenged in multiple districts as of June 2025. Several courts (e.g., 9th Circuit) have granted injunctions against sudden TPS removals due to due process concerns.\n\n\t•\tAsylum applicants are protected by statute (INA § 208) from removal while their case is pending. The Biden administration initially attempted fast-track denials, but courts in 2024 ruled this unconstitutional without a full hearing.\n\n\t•\tDACA is under Supreme Court review again in 2025, but meanwhile, revoking DACA based on non-violent infractions or dubious claims has resulted in ICE lawsuits across 14 states.\n\nYour argument makes it sound like everyone is fair game for deportation. But immigration status is not binary—it’s governed by a complex structure of statutory protection, court precedent, and due process rights.\n\nCLAIM: “Due process happens at immigration court and BIA. Attorneys aren’t provided because these aren’t criminal proceedings.”\n\nFACT CHECK:\n\nThis is technically true—but omits key realities:\n\n\t•\tOver 70% of detained immigrants don’t have legal representation, and studies have shown that access to counsel increases the likelihood of successful case outcomes by over 400%.\n\n\t•\tThe Biden administration’s 2023 “Dedicated Docket” system sped up proceedings at the cost of fairness. In many cases, immigrants had just 10 days to find a lawyer, gather documentation, and prepare. Courts and advocacy groups have blasted this as “due process theater.”\n\n\t•\tIn 2025, the National Immigrant Justice Center documented that ICE regularly moves detainees across state lines, isolating them from legal aid networks and family—often without adequate notice or access to interpreters or phones.\n\nCLAIM: “ICE doesn’t commandeer local agencies.”\n\nFACT CHECK:\n\nThey don’t technically, but they do pressure them through 287(g) agreements—outsourcing immigration enforcement to local police. As of mid-2025, dozens of municipalities have ended these agreements, citing abuse, false detentions, and increased mistrust between immigrant communities and law enforcement.\n\nYour post is like a law school textbook selectively quoted by someone who skipped civil rights class. Yes, ICE operates legally—but within a tight framework of constitutional law, judicial precedent, and policy reforms that are actively changing as of June 2025.\n\nFacts still matter. Due process still matters. And no, your legal justifications don’t turn civil liberties into optional accessories.\n\nTime to read beyond the headlines—or at least cite something from this decade.",

                "body": "Warrants: I never claimed that ICE can enter a home without a warrant. I wrote that ICE can make warrantless arrests. Your attempt at deflection is a feeble. \n\nReasonable suspicion: You agree with me. Questioning a person at the level of reasonable suspicion often ends up at the level of probable cause……. and the arrest. That’s why the line of questioning began. \n\nRacial profiling: ICE does not, nor has ever, worn body-cams. The studies that you refer to relate to other law enforcement agencies, apparently across 5 states. They have no relevance to what ICE does.\n\nTPS/Asylum/DACA: Again, your post backs-up what I wrote. Thank you for that. Something being challenged is irrelevant until such time that a decision is rendered. An immigration application does not convey any sort of legal immigration status. (I’ll also add that the recent increase in arrests of Asylum “applicants” is not true; the Asylum applications have been denied and the cases terminated.)\n\nDue process: Once again, your post backs-up what I wrote. Thanks again. Immigration proceedings are administrative, not criminal. That means the 6th Amendment right to an attorney does not apply. Of course, people are free to arrange for an attorney at their own expense. Also, ICE is a federal agency that operates nationwide. Often, detention space in limited in certain states, thereby necessitating moving a detainee across state lines. In some states, politicians have coerced local or county facilities to not renew detention contract that they had with ICE; some states have passed laws prohibiting such contracts with ICE. So, it is not surprising at all that ICE moves detainees across state lines. \n\nCommandeering local agencies: And yet again, you agree with me! The 287(g) agreements in no way commandeer local/county/state agencies. If you have any claims of them actually “commandeering” such agencies, I’d like to hear about it. I’m sure others would, too.\n\nYou even wrote, “Yes, ICE operates legally”. I already know that. \nIf the many “lawsuits” and “legal challenges” that you refer to are successful, perhaps things will change a bit.\n\nUntil then……..ICE will continue to arrest, just like they did under Biden, Obama, Bush, etc",

            "body": "Oh, the irony would be delicious if it weren’t so embarrassingly undercooked.\n\nLet’s unpack this stew of bad-faith takes and bargain-bin logic:\n\nFirst—no, the vast majority of January 6 defendants were not held in isolation for 18 months without trial. That myth gets passed around like a bottle at a tailgate, but facts are stubborn things. Most were released pending trial, many struck plea deals, and those held longer? Usually had violent felony charges—you know, for beating cops, smashing windows, and trying to overthrow a democratic election. Not exactly jaywalking.\n\nSecond—yes, due process applies to everyone on U.S. soil, including migrants, asylum seekers, and yes, even people accused of terrorism. That’s not a Democrat wish list item, that’s the U.S. Constitution. It’s not a Netflix subscription—you don’t get to cancel it when it’s inconvenient.\n\nThird—calling migrants “criminal illegals and foreign terrorists” just screams, “I lost an argument and now I’m yelling slurs into the void.” As of June 2025, even DHS data under Trump 2.0 doesn’t support the idea of a border overrun by terrorists—it’s just a louder rerun of the same panic politics used to distract from real issues, like the billionaire tax breaks you’re oddly silent about.\n\nSo if you’re confused about who’s defending freedom and who’s throwing tantrums about brown people getting lawyers, maybe don’t project your willful blindness onto others. And as for being “congenitally stupid”? You’re the one arguing the Constitution should only apply when it flatters your Twitter feed.\n\nPick a new talking point. This one’s expired.",

      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "STAND WITH LA: THE FIGHT AGAINST TRUMP’S ILLEGAL RAIDS &amp; THE PRIVATE DEPORTATION MACHINE HAS BEGUN\n\nJune 8, 2025 — Los Angeles is under siege. Trump’s rogue ICE forces, backed by private detention profiteers, are tearing families apart in midnight raids, snatching legal immigrants off the streets, and disappearing them into a for-profit deportation system that defies due process. This is not enforcement—this is **ethnic cleansing by bureaucracy**, and it will not stand.  \n\nThe people of LA have risen up, blocking ICE vans, shutting down detention centers, and exposing the corruption of corporations like GEO Group and CoreCivic, who get richer with every soul they imprison. But this is only the beginning. Trump’s fascist playbook demands escalation, and so must we.  \n\nTHIS IS THE OPENING SHOT OF A CIVIL WAR\n\nTrump’s 2025 mass deportation agenda—fueled by Stephen Miller’s racist policies and rubber-stamped by a complicit Supreme Court—has turned America into a police state for immigrants. But when the government shreds the Constitution, the people have the right—no, the duty—to resist.\n\nWHAT MUST BE DONE TO WIN\n\n1. Expand the Blockades– \n\nSurround every detention facility, ICE office, and federal courthouse. No more business as usual.  \n\n2. Neighbourhood Defense Networks– \n\nOrganize rapid response teams to document raids, interfere with arrests, and protect vulnerable communities.  \n\n3. Strike &amp; Boycott– \n\nHit the corporations complicit in this system. GEO Group, CoreCivic, their investors, and their contractors must face economic ruin.  \n\n4. Armed Community Protection– \n\nIf ICE comes with guns, we will not be unarmed victims. Train, prepare, and stand guard.  \n\n5. Defy the Courts– \n\nWhen judges rubber-stamp deportations, we must refuse to comply. Jury nullification, sanctuary cities, and mass non-cooperation must become the norm.  \n\nTHE TIME FOR PEACEFUL PROTEST IS OVER\n\nTrump doesn’t care about petitions. The GOP doesn’t fear marches. They only understand force. If they want a civil war, we will give them one, not with their terms, but ours. A war of strikes, sabotage, and unrelenting resistance until the deportation machine is dismantled.  \n\nTo the protesters in LA: You are the front lines. The nation is watching. Hold the line. Fight harder. We are coming.\n\nGC\n\n#AbolishICE #NoBanNoWallNoDeportations #CivilWar2025",

Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.\n\nHere’s his full quote, and most of it still applies. White reluctance in pushing for social justice, equality and humanity is the root cause of these riots.",

      "text": "The Strategic Calculus Behind Trump’s ICE Raids: A Prelude to Civil Unrest and the Insurrection Act\n\nIntro\n\nThe recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles have reignited debates surrounding the Trump administration’s long-standing strategy of leveraging state-sanctioned enforcement actions to incite civil unrest. A closer examination of this tactic reveals a calculated effort to destabilize social order, thereby creating a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act—a move that would grant the executive sweeping powers to deploy military forces domestically. \n\nMy analysis situates Trump’s actions within a broader authoritarian playbook, drawing upon historical precedents, legal frameworks, and contemporary political dynamics to elucidate his master plan and propose counterstrategies.  \n\nThe ICE Raids as a Provocation Mechanism\n\nTrump’s escalation of ICE operations in predominantly Democratic strongholds like Los Angeles is not an isolated enforcement measure but a deliberate provocation. By targeting sanctuary cities with high immigrant populations, his administration incites fear, resistance, and public outcry—elements that can quickly escalate into civil disturbances. Historical parallels exist, notably in the use of federal force to suppress dissent (e.g., the 1992 L.A. riots, the 2020 George Floyd protests), but Trump’s approach is distinct in its premeditation. Internal documents and past statements confirm his belief that chaos legitimizes authoritarian consolidation—a tactic well-documented in political science literature on democratic backsliding. \n\nJust read this and you’ll get it! (Levitsky &amp; Ziblatt, 2018).  \n\nThe Insurrection Act: Legal Pathways and Strategic Intent\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 permits the president to deploy the U.S. military domestically to suppress \"insurrection, domestic violence, or unlawful combinations.\" While its use has been rare in modern history, Trump has repeatedly signalled his willingness to invoke it, at least from the comments I’ve seen — including during the 2020 protests (White House memos, 2020). His rhetoric framing immigration as an \"invasion\" (echoing the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory) and linking it to crime lays the groundwork for declaring a breakdown of civil order—a necessary condition for the Act’s implementation.  \n\nTrump’s Master Plan: Authoritarian Entrenchment\n\nThe broader strategy appears to be a multi-phase authoritarian consolidation:  \n\n1. Provoke Unrest\n\nUse divisive policies (ICE raids, anti-protest legislation) to galvanize opposition and create visible chaos.  \n\n2. Legitimize Militarized Response\n\nFrame protests or resistance as \"violent leftist mobs,\" justifying military intervention.  \n\n3. Suspend Norms\n\nExploit the crisis to curtail civil liberties, suppress dissent, and erode institutional checks.  \n\n4. Electoral Manipulation\n\nLeverage the instability to discredit opponents, manipulate electoral processes, or delay elections under emergency powers.  \n\nThis playbook aligns with global authoritarian trends, from Orbán’s Hungary to Duterte’s Philippines, where crises are weaponized to dismantle democracy.  \n\nCounterstrategies: How to Stop Trump’s Authoritarian Play\n\n1. Legal and Legislative Barriers\n\n   - Congress must preemptively clarify and restrict the Insurrection Act’s scope, requiring legislative approval for prolonged deployments.  \n\n   - State and local governments should reinforce legal challenges to federal overreach, as seen in sanctuary city litigation.  \n\n2. Grassroots and Institutional Resistance\n\n   - Community Defense Networks\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups, such as the National Immigration Law Center, must expand rapid-response systems to monitor and document raids, reducing panic and misinformation.  \n\n   - Media Vigilance\n\nFact-based reporting must counter the administration’s narrative of \"lawless chaos,\" emphasizing provocation as the root cause.  \n\n3. Judicial and Electoral Safeguards\n\n- The judiciary must remain a check on executive overreach, particularly in reviewing the proportionality of military deployments.  \n\n   - Mobilizing voter turnout to prevent Trump’s re-election is critical; authoritarian consolidation becomes exponentially harder if he lacks a mandate.  \n\nConclusion\n\nTrump’s ICE raids are not merely about immigration enforcement but are a strategic gambit to fabricate the conditions for authoritarian rule. Recognizing this tactic is the first step in countering it; the second is deploying multi-institutional resistance to uphold democratic norms. As of tonight, the urgency of this threat cannot be overstated—only coordinated, preemptive action can avert the slide into militarized autocracy.  \n\nGC",

I want to do more than that though, and I guess that's where I'm stuck. I live in an area where if there are any ICE raids happening, I can't seem to find out about them. And if that means none are happening good, but I have feeling that's not the case. I want to help and be more involved in the fight to stop ICE but what are some more things I can do? Both preventative and during a raid, what would everyone else suggest?\n\nStopping raids and getting ICE to leave is great, but I feel as though as they'll start to respond with more force soon, or more drastic measures to counter the protests. Idk this post is all over the place but I'm just not sure what else to do to help other than wait to be alerted about an ice raid near me. I want to take preventative action, not wait for the action to take action.",

In the area I live I'm a good 6-8 hours away from any large cities where protests or marches would likely be happening. Any protest that I've ever seen locally has been MAGA, so I guess my question then would be how to find out about protests or marches locally? I have a local volunteer organization I've just found out about I'm going to try and get involved in and that may answer my questions, but I've never understood how or where people get the word about local events.  \n\n  \nBut again thank you sm you''ve given me some more accounts and things to look into, and I appreciate it a lot :D!",

It gives states the authority to protect their people when the federal government overreaches, fails, or targets them.\n\n What is the federal government for, if not to serve us all?\n\n And if it won’t what power do the states have to act?",

He is surrounded by yes men, and he has both chambers of congress and the SCOTUS behind him. \n\nAs an example, if the California governor were to puch back against the fed actions, the dictator would only double down. I am sure the dictator has no problem deploying the military and using deadly force on californians, but the yes men are probably telling him that is not the right time for that. \n\nI think dem governors are the rational ones in this exchange. They want to solve the issue without violence. Only escalating the pushback if they truly need so. But in order to do so, they need more support from the people in the state. And so far, it seems like americans are fine with the regime kidnapping and disappearing human beings in american soil (very patriotic). Hopefully, now that is the summer, young people will see what is happening and get more involved. \n\nOne thing is for certain TACO Trump will eventually fold, but at what cost.",

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "On June 6, 2025, the United States witnessed a significant escalation in immigration enforcement activities, particularly in Los Angeles, where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a series of raids resulting in the detention of over 40 individuals. These operations, executed without warrants, targeted various locations including Home Depot stores, a doughnut shop, and a clothing warehouse . ￼ ￼\n\nThe aggressive nature of these raids, characterized by the use of unmarked vehicles and the absence of judicial oversight, sparked immediate and widespread protests. Demonstrators, including prominent figures such as David Huerta, president of SEIU California, who was arrested during the protests, gathered to denounce what they perceived as unlawful and inhumane actions by federal authorities . Clashes between protesters and law enforcement ensued, with reports of tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and physical confrontations . ￼\n\nThese events are part of a broader intensification of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Notably, on June 5, 2025, ICE detained at least 15 individuals, including a three-year-old child, during routine check-ins in San Francisco . Furthermore, ICE arrests surged to 2,200 in a single day, following directives from senior administration officials to ramp up enforcement efforts . ￼ ￼\n\nIn response to these developments, citizens and advocacy groups are mobilizing to oppose what they view as violations of constitutional rights and human dignity. Legal experts emphasize that warrantless detentions and deportations contravene the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Community organizations are advocating for increased public awareness, legal support for detainees, and policy reforms to ensure accountability and adherence to due process.\n\nThe events of June 6, 2025, underscore the ongoing tensions between federal immigration policies and civil liberties. As the nation grapples with these challenges, the role of informed citizenry and robust legal advocacy remains crucial in upholding the principles of justice and human rights.\n",

Instead they are passing a budget reconciliation bill with a provision to severely limit contempt rulings, which undermines the court system and rule of law! Call your representatives and senators, and demand that they take action to remove the unAmerican and lawless President and his cabinet.**  \n  \nThe open cruelty and terror is the intent. Film and harass these pigs. Alert your community when raids are nearby. Tell people their rights. They can't take you without a warrant signed by a judge. Don't let them stop you by threatening the FBI, these actions do not impede their crimes and they will eventually lose in court as they always do. They know it. That's why they wear masks and argue in court on procedural grounds, not merit. That's why they are targeting helpless mothers and zip-tieing children, and we've never heard of a single shot fired or knife pulled by a gang member on an ICE goon.  \nWe *cannot* let this continue; they've already proven it doesn't stop at immigrants, even legal ones; permanent residents and U.S. citizens have been detained for hours, weeks, months without charges, and even expelled. It's indefensible. By definition, you can't \"deport\" a citizen. Multiple children, even with cancer and no medical attention, have been deliberately banished. Shipping a person to a country other than their own is not \"deporting,\" it's renditioning. DHS records show they were very much aware they were sending hundreds without any U.S. criminal record to CECOT. The regime is *still* disobeying the unanimous SCOTUS order to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, which Trump admitted on camera that he could do with a single phone call.",

      "text": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has intensified its enforcement actions, conducting warrantless home raids across the country. These operations, often involving forced entries and aggressive tactics, have raised significant legal and ethical concerns. ￼\n\nICE Conducts Warrantless Home Raids Under Alien Enemies Act\n\nA leaked memo from the Department of Justice, dated March 14, 2025, reveals that ICE agents have been authorized to enter homes without judicial warrants to apprehend individuals suspected of being “alien enemies,” particularly targeting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. This directive invokes the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime statute granting the president authority to detain and deport noncitizens during times of war. Legal experts argue that this application of the law violates the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.  ￼ ￼\n\n\nReports of Aggressive Tactics and Community Impact\n\nIn California’s Central Coast, communities have reported a surge in ICE raids, with agents conducting arrests without warrants and targeting undocumented individuals, including Indigenous Mixtec-speaking farmworkers. These actions have led to widespread fear and disruption among local residents.  ￼\n\nIn Oklahoma City, a woman reported that ICE agents forced her and her daughters outside into the rain without allowing them to dress, highlighting the aggressive nature of these raids.  ￼\n\n\nLegal Challenges and Public Outcry\n\nCivil liberties organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of these warrantless raids. In Chicago, 22 individuals arrested in ICE raids announced federal court action, alleging unlawful arrests and violations of a 2022 federal court settlement.  ￼ ￼\n\nPublic protests have erupted nationwide in response to these enforcement actions. In Los Angeles, demonstrators temporarily occupied portions of the Hollywood Freeway, while in San Diego, over a thousand participants marched against mass deportations.  ￼\n\n\nKnow Your Rights\n\nLegal experts emphasize that individuals have constitutional rights regardless of immigration status. ICE agents cannot enter a home without a valid judicial search warrant or the resident’s consent. If approached by ICE, individuals are advised to remain silent and request to see a warrant before allowing entry.  ￼ ￼\n\n\nThe escalation of ICE’s enforcement tactics has sparked a national debate on immigration policy, civil liberties, and the balance between national security and individual rights. As legal challenges proceed and public demonstrations continue, the future of these practices remains uncertain.\n\nGC",

It ONLY stops them from using the AEA to send suspected gang members to another country.\n\nMore info on the decision:\n\nSCOTUS sent the case back to the lower court to clarify \n\n*how much notice* (SCOTUS did say that less than 24 hours isn't enough) \n\n*What kind of notice* (also adding that it's insufficient to only provide a vague notice that they're going to be immediately removed from the country, which is only in English with no info on how to challenge it).",

      "text": "ICE RAIDS - URGENT MESSAGE — 16 May 2025\n\nICE raids have escalated across California, with aggressive operations now targeting homes, workplaces, and community spaces. Reports from Los Angeles, Fresno, and the Bay Area describe early-morning detentions, families torn apart, and unlawful entries—often without warrants or proper identification. These tactics are alarmingly similar to those used by authoritarian regimes: intimidation, racial profiling, and unchecked force.\n\nThis is far more than an immigration issue—it is a human rights emergency. When state power is used without oversight or respect for due process, everyone’s rights are endangered.\n\nThe people of the world must take note. The erosion of civil liberties anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nNow is the time to resist. Speak up. Support sanctuary networks. Document abuses. Demand that local and state leaders take action.\n\nWe cannot accept Gestapo-style tactics in any democratic society. The people must push back—decisively and together.\n\nDefend rights. Protect families. Fight authoritarianism.\n\nGC",

When you all marched blasey ford to keep kavanaigh from getting a nomination, and had her lie under oath. That was upholding the constitution? When you all harvested illegal ballots in battle ground states, had a speaker do insider trading, had a past president curcunvent congress for one or the largest healthcare debacles ever, and most recently had a president lie that he was fit to be in office. There is a good chance he didn’t even run the office. So let me hear again, who is standing for the Constitution? The party that shuts down the other from hate? Nope. It’s not the Democratic Party. Hasn’t been since the days of slavery. Keep on thinking so while you continue this degradation of our country. You people smell of shit. As you try to say you didn’t shit your pants.

My side if I have one respects that we have a real easy path to birthright citizenship since 1949 at least, but actually 1898. One of your parents has to hold a green card. That was clarified about the amendment granting citizenship to children of slaves 120 years ago. I do not support abortion, or even “trans” child mutilation. I would be with the opposite side.\n\nI am not a citizen of the world or affected by the opinion of any other nation. If MAGA decides to concern themselves with that, so be it, it’s pointless. I voted for this and more of this like the majority of Americans. I talk about it all of the time with my oldest, and will at appropriate ages.\n\nWhatever my last thoughts are, they won’t be regrets unless I do something very uncharacteristic in the interim. I will regret voting for this if the country is still like it was under Biden until everyone demanded Trump back to do exactly what he campaigned around the clock to do, and *won*. And when the stakes are this high, the loser loses everything. Their very power. It must really be terrifying. But don’t worry, Trump hasn’t come close to the 27 million deported by the 3 previous administration (2 democrats).\n\nAll of those things say I’m right. See above.\n\nI believe in Christ, but not that I will merit salvation according to the qualifications outlined in the Bible, I struggle. Jesus did not advocate for the mass criminal exploitation of our nation by healthy people illegally entering from a nation in which most of the population raises a family, just because there is more prosperity here. Certainly not on behalf of the people of a nation that is very adamant in enforcing their own border laws, and not until intense pressure from the left even allowed anyone to pass through their border. In doing so we would be vouching under Christ the actions of these opportunist immigrants that he himself condemned.\n\nNow, what exactly do you feel about abortion, gay marriage, trans, DEI, just for starters as a Christian of such Bible thumping, judgmental merit?",

So you, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.”\n\nDeuteronomy 27:19:  ““Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.”  Then all the people shall say, “Amen!””\n\nHebrews 13:1-3:  “Keep on loving each other ….

Sodom’s sins were pride, gluttony, and laziness, while the poor and needy suffered outside her door.  She was proud and committed detestable sins, so I wiped her out ….”\n\nMatthew 25:41-45:  Jesus said “‘Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons.   For I was hungry, and you didn’t feed me.  I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me a drink.  I was a stranger, and you didn’t invite me into your home.  …  Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?’   And [I] will answer, ‘… when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.’”\n\n\nWhy don't you read the Bible?",

I would add that the country is *exactly* the same under Trump as it was under Biden: Congress has done very little legislatively and Congress (the legislature) is the composition, while the Executive Office is just a guitar solo, to use an analogy.  Congress has done little to work for the average American under Biden or Trump or Obama or Bush Jr. etc.  Ironically, Warren Buffet (who is part of the problem) noted the national debt solution is to tie Congressional re-election to a balanced budget, meaning, if no system is in place to hold lawmakers to account, why should they stick their necks out to fix the *many* problems facing the US?\n\nThe political party system should be dismantled so that there is one America, since the political party system obscures the path to the social contract (formalized as a constitution) which needs to be retooled by all Americans.  The party system is a cancer, and the division is a cancer...a social contract will determine whether a system divided can be a system balanced...everyone's productive viewpoint is valid, but to achieve balance, there also must be compromise.\n\nI cannot speak for this Jesus Christ historical character, but the Church did what it had to do to appropriate certain rituals, e.g. the crucifix (from the Etruscans) and if that works for Christians, then so be it.  I'm not sure that Christianity jibes with the fact that Capitalism is sanctioned misbehavior--Americans need to decide whether doing the right thing is important, because the country is currently predicated on doing the *wrong* thing.\n\nI suggest taking a look on Google maps at the Lincoln Memorial and see what Abraham Lincoln's hands are resting on--not the furniture itself--but the actual component.  The answer lies there.",

Thus, at a minimum, those methods should be available still for Trump to use. If Clinton was able to use due process to deport 12, Bush added to the ability to quickly deport with his removal process, and Obama opened the migrant detention centers to facilitate deportation. Added to that the massive influx of illegal migration since the Obama administration and the relative decrease in deportation from Trump thus far, it would seem by any metric he can use due process to deport an unprecedented number of millions",

This is why judge Hannah Dugan isn't / wasn't legally required to permit ice into her courtroom; instead, and made them wait in the public area of the courthouse for the defendant to come out.)\n\nI have not seen any videos of ice breaking into someone's home with only an administrative warrant - that doesn't mean that it hasn't happened - but if it does, the people in that home will be able to bring a case in court.\n\nAnd that's how you end up getting an appellate decision (case law) that *should* - hopefully - rein the type of behavior that we're seeing from ice. Even if only bc the individual officers will face consequences / repercussions.\n\nNotice that it requires a few things to happen: \n\n1) people must exercise their constitutional rights and refuse entry to any law enforcement officer without a valid judicial warrant. \n\n2) then, there must be an illegal action; aka, ice must violate a person or person's constitutional rights; and \n\n3) the people whose rights were violated must bring a lawsuit.\n\nIt is not completely unheard of for Law enforcement officers to violate people's Constitutional rights. Most of the time when it happens, the people are unable or unwilling to bring a lawsuit about it. \n\nSo the officers do it again to other people - intentionally or unintentionally - bc they were not held accountable for their actions. (In some cases, officers are given incorrect information regarding the law or have very poor training; this is not an excuse. I'm just saying that violating people's constitutional rights is not as rare as most people would hope.)\n\nA recent example would be in Luigi mangione's case; his attorney filed a motion asking the court to throw out certain evidence that officers apparently found in his backpack bc it was an illegal warrantless search. \n\nAnyway, all of this was just to say - yes, they are violating the Constitution, but if/when they begin breaking down people's doors without judicial warrants, that's such a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment that it will certainly be challenged in court. \n\n(There's also reason to believe that they plan to do this at some point; specifically: there have been multiple news articles reporting that this administration believes that the Alien Enemies Act permits ice to enter people's homes without a warrant if they suspect a supposed \"alien enemy\" is inside.)",

Or are you implying that I am a bigot against the “race” such as is it is of the illegal immigrants? I did all of those things to make a point to you on Reddit years later? And I really secretly hate the woman I staked my entire existence on and begged her to link bloodline with me? Bigot against half of each of my only children? \n\nSince you can’t provide any link between me and the definition you googled for bigot just now, even you can understand how me and anyone like me could care less about anything you or anyone like you calls us, what you think, feel, or anything else about you including your very existence.\n\nDo you think you are the first person to dig that statement up about “citizens?” and try to relate it to something? How much of it did you read? You in real, waking life just sent me an abc article quoting Trump musing the idea of only sending the worse of the worse violent criminals. My children are gifted honor students. Are you calling them the worst of criminals? Is that all you got to demonize Trump and exculpate Obama and Clinton who deported more? I believe that everyone should enjoy equal rights and nobody should succeed or fail based solely upon any immutable identity characteristic, and that we should enforce our immigration laws for a myriad of reasons. If that is controversial then most Americans hold controversial opinions on the topic. Again, nobody cares what words feckless armchair nobodies learned to use against them. I have destroyed everything you have said. Show me one “W” in this whole conversation you can rightly claim. I think that obtuse is the antonym of what you were looking for on your thesaurus app. And this. IS my real free time. You butted into a conversation loser",

This includes contributions from both legal and undocumented immigrants, who are essential to the U.S. labor market and contribute to various sectors like healthcare and agriculture.”\n\n[and this is how you cite your source](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-does-immigration-affect-us-economy#:~:text=Yes.,United%20States)",

For instance, CIS claims undocumented immigrants are a net fiscal burden of over $700 billion over their lifetimes. However they ignore economic contributions, like undocumented immigrants' indirect taxes (sales, property, payroll via false SSNs). They also fail to consider the economic value created by immigrant labor, consumption, and entrepreneurship. They also overestimate public service usage, especially in assuming all undocumented immigrants use the full range of welfare.\n\nWhen you look at independent research from the National Academies of Sciences, Cato Institute, and Brookings Institution, they presents a more nuanced approach to the economic impact of immigrants, which happen to contradict the agenda driven selective analysis produced by CIS.",

TPS and refugees are allowed by law to access short term assistance as are regular citizens. Other countries supoirt their refugees temporarily.They actually get denied benefits more often than citizens.  They are also now buying homes, working and actually rebooted the area economy. Taken over dilapated houses and working jobs regular citizens won't do. They have also opened up restaurants. This is a normal repatriation the US has done for decades when home countries are completely ungovernable and in war. Springfield REQUESTED the immigrant influx as the town was economically dying and major shortage of workers.\n\nStill as small amount of expenditure to the total picture of immigrant and now they give back to the tax base.\n\nAccording to www.ITEP.org. undocumented and legal non citizens contributed to Ohio  $127 M in 2022 and $236 .1 M federally\n\nA few months of benefits is a drop in the bucket compared to the economic benefit to the community and state\n\nGo on be racist .

If we want to live there, do we not need the correct documentation.  Problem is everyone wants to live in the US. Correct. So if they do, go through the proper Channels. Just because they pay taxes and such, doesn’t mean anything. Identity’s can be faked. Not saying again all instances are like this but before trump got in office, it was getting out of hand.  I know many immigrants that have lived here along time from Mexico and Cuba and all over and they all agrees they did all the proper paperwork. Why didn’t these people.  Most of them that are targeted have some issues with that. No one going to agree with everything. I don’t agree with all of trumps ideas either but some of it I do.  This is all over due.",

      "title": "ICE Raids Are Hurting People",
      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids can hurt people in a variety of ways—emotionally, economically, socially, and even physically. Here are the main ways they cause harm:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Psychological Trauma\n\t•\tFear and anxiety: Families—especially children—often live in constant fear of being separated from loved ones. Even the threat of a raid can cause stress and PTSD.\n\t•\tImpact on children: Children of undocumented parents, even if they are U.S. or Canadian citizens, may experience long-term emotional and developmental damage after a parent is detained or deported.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Family Separation\n\t•\tRaids often lead to sudden arrests, tearing families apart without notice or time to make arrangements.\n\t•\tIn many cases, children are left without caregivers or placed into foster care, even when they are legal residents or citizens.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Economic Hardship\n\t•\tIf a primary breadwinner is detained or deported, families can lose their main source of income.\n\t•\tSmall businesses owned or operated by undocumented workers may collapse.\n\t•\tEven legal residents in mixed-status families might lose jobs due to disruptions or fear of association.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Community Destabilization\n\t•\tRaids create fear and mistrust of authorities in immigrant communities, even among legal residents.\n\t•\tPeople become afraid to go to school, work, hospitals, or even report crimes, making entire communities less safe and healthy.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Due Process Violations\n\t•\tICE has been criticized for:\n\t•\tArresting individuals without warrants.\n\t•\tConducting raids based on unreliable information.\n\t•\tDenying people access to lawyers.\n\t•\tPressuring detainees to sign voluntary departure agreements without understanding their rights.\n\n⸻\n\n6. Health and Safety Risks\n\t•\tDetention centers have been reported to have poor conditions, including inadequate medical care, abuse, and overcrowding.\n\t•\tSome detainees with chronic illnesses or disabilities may not receive appropriate treatment.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Racial and Ethnic Profiling\n\t•\tICE raids often disproportionately target Latin American communities, reinforcing stereotypes and fueling discrimination.\n\t•\tInnocent people can be detained simply for “looking undocumented.”\n\n⸻\n\n8. Misinformation and Panic\n\t•\tRumors of raids can spread quickly, leading to unnecessary panic, missed work and school, and widespread fear.\n\t•\tFalse information can exacerbate mental health issues and erode trust in institutions and media.\n\n⸻\n\nSummary:\n\nICE raids are not just law enforcement actions; they carry broad human, social, and economic costs. While their stated goal is immigration control, the methods used often result in collateral damage that disproportionately affects vulnerable people, including legal residents and citizens.",

We need a path to legal status (not necessarily citizenship), particularly for those who were brought here under the age of 18. Furthermore, I’m not falling for anything. I employ people, serve on volunteer and corporate boards and have traveled all over the world. Our system is dysfunctional and needs reform.",

The reason for the so called difficulties is like all other countries we have the right to determine that new immigrants are here to be simulating into our society and are able to contribute, not a drain on our resources! Another reason is that by having a process, only those who really wanted to be an American would want to go through the process. Furthermore, when we trickle down the numbers coming in, we will have enough resources to help when needed. The last few years of open border policy has resulted in this chaos not to mention, those who were supposedly here to seek asylum only successful in bringing their problems with them here. The US is currently more like third world country living especially in the big cities! For those of us who are legal immigrants, we came here for the American way of life. If we wanted third world living, we would have stayed where we were. So there will be no sympathy to those illegals who jumped the queue, basically giving our immigration laws the middle finger! Self deportation and come in the legal way!\nYour narrative of those undocumented being upstanding citizens is only a sliver of all the illegals that are here!",

Our economic sanctions policies in Venezuela (for one example) have contributed to a mass exodus because we crippled their economy and caused stratospheric inflation. Maduro was literally handing out food boxes to stave off starvation. If we don’t want refugees then we shouldn’t punish ordinary people to get to their leaders. The US is sanctioning anywhere between 20% (direct) to 33% (including indirect) of the countries on the planet. We’ve bombed millions of civilians over the last 25 years and caused enormous displacements. What does that get us but economic refugees, brutal crackdowns in those countries and desperate people fleeing their homes? Then cynical politicians exploit the situations THEY created to gin up votes and deflect from their own incompetence.

                                    "body": "I agreed with you that these illegals Venezuelan were economic refugees created partly due to our sanctions. Not to enlarge the perimeters of our argument, the Venezuelan economy has always been bad due to corruption and high inflation etc., There were political reasons why we imposed those sanctions ( not that I agreed with our politicians). By right, we do not even need to help with these economic refugees. The idea was to ‘punish’ their government into changing their policies. One of the ways obviously is to push for their people to revolt against their government. Taking in their people counteracted the sanctions imposed. Yes, people are pawns unfortunately. Anyway, the illegals from the open border policy came from ALL over the world in droves, we are not responsible for all. Most of these illegals purposely lost their ID before crossing in an attempt to avoid being tracked.  Making it hard to get them, hence the raids. \nCharity begins at home, let’s look within our border and see the devastation these massive illegals do to our own communities. The US itself is funding two wars and we are in debt in trillions . The Feds are unable to print money fast enough to keep with our spending. With in our communities we are dealing with natural disasters, our sanctuary cities are cutting funds from all services to provide food and shelters to these people whose loyalty remain with their own countries ( just look at what flags they are trashing and what flags they are hugging in these riots). These dissents got to be sent back, if they failed to indicate where they were from originally, then they will be sent to a country that will accept them. They are lucky the have a choice, other countries( Poland, Hungary) would not give them even a choice.\nAs for those undocumented who have been here for a long time and have long assimilated into our society. They can appeal to come back. Right now, it is too massive an operation to deal in fineness. People failed to understand how massive operations work. Notice how much of these tear jerking ‘arrests’ shown on videos are of Latino and Hispanic descent?! A lot of illegals from other countries went through the same process have accepted their fate and left quietly!",

Which is someone with no formal training looking for any employment. Who might be starving from adverse conditions or horrible working conditions outside of the country. Then after getting the card will have to remain employed for another 5 years doing less than living wage jobs to even be approved for citizenship. That's more than ten years working 10-12 hrs a day. For some people that is a death sentence. On top of that the person needs to get into or be brought into the country to be employed. So it's a catch 22 for most immigrants. \n\nSo can you explain to me again why we are shipping these people off to concentration camps?",

      "text": "As of May 15, 2025, many people arrested in ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids have no criminal record.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n\t•\tOver 48% of individuals held in ICE detention have no criminal record. Many others have only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.  ￼\n\n\t•\tICE has mistakenly detained U.S. citizens, including Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, who was born in Georgia and held in Florida despite showing his ID and birth certificate.  ￼\n\n\t•\tSome individuals were arrested during routine activities. For example, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student, was detained at his citizenship interview, even though he had no criminal charges.  ￼\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nICE raids can lead to the detention of people who haven’t committed serious crimes—or any crimes at all. This includes students, legal residents, and even U.S. citizens. Such actions can cause fear, family separation, and harm to communities.\n\nGC",

ICE then decides whether to begin removal proceedings, and if so, will issue a Notice to Appear (NTA), which officially starts the civil immigration proceedings. Simultaneously, ICE determines whether the individual will be detained or released on bond during the removal process.”\n\nNow what is happening is the Illegal Immigrants are being released on bond or parole. Even asylum seekers are pretty much on bond/parole with a very few small exceptions- but they are still in removal process. When you fuck up on bond what happens? You go back to dentition \nEvery one of these 10 second Tiltoks are not “someone called ICE on my neighbor” - they are coming to get illegal immigrants who are already in the system who have missed court dates - ordered to self deport because their status is denied and they won’t leave or have committed criminal acts/got arrested",

They've been threatening martial law for some time now. I'm much more afraid of my rights being taken away than I am of immigrants coming here without papers, especially when many of them are refugees and seeking refugee status is perfectly legal.\n\nPlus, if illegal status is such a problem, why are they trying to make even more people illegal by revoking legal status of so many? It must be because the stated number of illegal immigrants has been grossly exaggerated and they need to kick out people who are here legally so they can say they \"deported\" so many millions of \"illegals\".

So now you're at an ICE detention center. Why? Because you weren't at the wrong place, wrong time and wrong skin color. \n\nThat's what is happening to some people in those detention centers, they're not illegal, they're not criminals, but because of skin color and unchecked ICE agency, the agents themselves are just getting anyone who they see with different shade of skin.

      "author": "Important_Lock_2238",
      "subreddit": "IceRaidAlerts",
      "text": "As of May 15, 2025, estimates indicate that approximately 1% to 1.5% of individuals detained or deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are U.S. citizens. This equates to hundreds of wrongful detentions each year. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) estimates that between 1% and 4% of ICE detainees may have credible claims to U.S. citizenship.  ￼ ￼\n\nThese errors often result from ICE’s reliance on incomplete or inaccurate databases and insufficient verification processes. For instance, between 2012 and early 2018, ICE wrongfully arrested and detained 1,480 U.S. citizens, some of whom were held for extended periods.  ￼\n\nNotable cases include:\n\n\t•\tJose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen from New Mexico, who was wrongfully detained by Border Patrol agents in Nogales, Arizona, for nearly 10 days.\n\n\t•\tJuan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S.-born citizen, who was detained in Florida despite presenting valid identification and a birth certificate.\n\nThese incidents underscore the importance of accurate identification processes and the protection of citizens’ rights during immigration enforcement actions.\n\nGC",

Thus, the Court determined, [e]ven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection.\n\nhttps://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-8-7-2/ALDE_00001262/\n\nSCOTUS, which interprets the Constitution, has reached this conclusion based on the plain language of the Constitution; \n\nspecifically bc of the use of the word PERSONS in the due process clause instead of the word CITIZENS:\n\nThe due process clause of the [5th Amendment ](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-5/) states: \n\n&gt;No PERSON shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\n\nCompare / Contrast that with:\n\n[15th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-15/)\n&gt;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged...\n\n[14th amendment ](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/)\n&gt;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\n\nETA: cc: u/bostonbruins922",

I’m just confused as to how they are considered illegally coming into the US when they were invited to come and bussed to different states. Just curious, not trying to start an argument or be called stupid. I don’t agree with how the previous administration allowed this but if the government invited them in how would they be considered coming illegally?  I’m sure I’ll still get rude comments but I don’t think any question is a stupid question.  ",

Many came over due to “threat of violence” but that has to be explicitely by either the govt or an organization. Saying your neighbor is threatening to kill you is not a legitimate case to seek asylum. Alot of them that where allowed in actually has no reason to seek asylum and therefore their statuses are being revoked under the new president. Under Biden, the law was not being applied. Under Trump, not only is the law being wnforced but new changes to the system are being made so things like this don’t happen again.",

Absolutely the criminals should be deported but the ones who have jobs and commit no crimes shouldn’t be punished. I read an article yesterday about a man, voted for Trump, has his own roofing business and had 8 or 9 immigrants with permission to work, they were pulled over by ICE in the company vehicle and deported. He said no US citizen will work, I believe it was in Texas, in the extreme heat, 12 hours a day. Now he has “buyers remorse” for voting for Trump. They are human beings, if they are working and not living off of taxpayers and committing no crimes and also the fact they were invited to come and had a work visa I don’t understand why they are being targeted? The roofing owner said they were good guys whom he became friends with. Just wait and see what happens to the US when no one else will take those kind of jobs. No one is any better than anyone else, people just don’t have a heart anymore. They don’t care what happens to the children they may have or the lives of other human beings. Just my opinion reading about how they are already criminals for being here illegally when they were invited to come, how is that considered criminal?  It’s just confusing to me. ",

No one is “letting minors transition” unless you count the tiny fraction of rare medical cases that go through a gauntlet of evaluations, parental consent, and state regulations. Puberty blockers?

But hey, don’t let basic facts or actual laws get in the way of whatever right-wing rag you read or watch told you to rage about. \n\nYou all are fucking obsessed, you bring it up during moments like this instead of focusing on the heinous shit that is happening in front of your face.",
