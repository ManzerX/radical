The PTA-winemom army that's been out there giving quotes like \u201c[If I am killed doing this, throw my body at the White House, martyr the shit out of me &amp; raise hell. Do not be sad. Do not think I would do anything differently. I would do it over &amp; over again \u2014 this is too important to sit down &amp; shut up and not do anything](https://bsky.app/profile/jcollins.bsky.social/post/3me27sqikes2f)\" will descend.\n\nAlso, even red states that hate their blue cities don't want Trump charging in to mess up their election behind the scenes, because Congress isn't the only thing on the ballot! Suppose Tulsi Gabbard shows up with the FBI to steal boxes of ballots. OK, now who's the new mayor? Who's the new dogcatcher? Does the county have authorization to issue that new school bond or not? Massive chaos from everyone on every losing side of whatever votes did get counted. \n\nI'm not saying they won't try something, but I don't think it'll go well for them. And the scale of what they'd need to do way exceeds the \\~20k illiterate foot soldiers they have to pull it off with. Their main weapon is instilling fear, and the best reaction to not give in to it, and to be prepared to react if something should happen.",

In the [1933 German elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1933_German_federal_election), the last multi-party election of the Weimar Republic, the Nazis deployed 50,000 stormtroopers to select voting locations across the country to intimidate voters. Germany had a population of about 70 million at the time, it was a federal republic just like the United States and with a proportional number of voting precincts. We all know how things developed from there. \n\nTo be fair, ICE currently only has 22,000 stormtroopers available for a country with 5 times the population, so they would have to spread themselves thinner. But at the end of the day, you only need to send them to the most strategic locations. And obviously ICE has just been given essentially unlimited money, so by November they may as well have doubled or tripled their numbers. \n\nFinally, voter intimidation is only going to be one of multiple attack vectors for the midterms. You also have voter suppression, relentless AI-supported propaganda across all forms of media, legal challenges up to and including a tame SCOTUS, and direct and indirect vote manipulation. You couldn't have the deck stacked more against you. The only way forward is to come out to vote in overwhelming numbers to get the fascists out.",

Pick and choose some of them strategically to deploy a small group of agents and you may be able to tip the scales just enough for the Republicans to keep the House. \n\nCertainly not disagreeing with you that a strategy that only relies on deploying ICE wouldn't be enough, but obviously it would work in concert with all the other things I mentioned as part of the overall fascist takeover toolkit.",

Supreme Court ruled that merely \"appearing like a foreigner\" is enough to stop and detain someone for questioning. So even if you legitimately ARE an American citizen (but lets say both of your parents or grandparents are Iraqi and you very much look middle eastern.. that's enough for ICE to detain you.

When ICE agents are being given monetary bonuses for number of detentions,. they don't care if you are legally an American citizen or not. \n\n* It's also a bullying tactic basically of \"Watch us be cruel to others,. and know we could do that to you if we wanted to, because there is no accountability and no one will stop us\".\n\nBasically \"suspicion of being Brown\" is enough to them.",

Like, for god's sake, the general public has been calling to abolish ICE.  Democrat congress people have been pushing for massive reform.  And Schumer's opening volley to republicans for negotiation isn't a maximal position, instead he is taking a position further to the right of the farthest right democrat's position.  And he's still losing that position!\n\nWhen you negotiate, your opening volley should always be one of the greatest value.  His opening volley should have been the complete dismantlement of DHS.  And when republicans obviously reject that, he puts it on them to figure out a middle position.  By opening with the weakest possible reform anyone could imagine, he's allowing negotiations to go in the obvious direction of a rejection and getting even weaker concessions.\n\nThe concessions Schumer has been extracting from republicans has been pinky promises to revisit an issue.  It's batshit insane.  He has massive public support to do the most aggressive actions imaginable to fight the trump admin and instead he's cooperating.",

Maybe a low-odds gamble, but better than doing nothing.  On the Dem side, I'm really hoping we can foster anti-Schumer discontent to get him out of the negotiating chair.  Because Schumer aggressively botches every single task given to him not involving Israel.  Even if they don't actually throw him in prison (I can dream), removing him from party leadership is a more realistic goal.  Because when you really want something, you come in hard asking for more than you think you'll get.

This was not a couple of suv's going to pick up a criminal, as the media is trying to portray. \n\nThis was huge armed gangs of basically secret police harassing people for ID and if they had an accent they were toast, hauled away to...where? \n\nThen the title of this insinuates the people trying to record this behavior are \"radicals\". Yet very little of the published footage shows the extent of what was going on, typically showing just a handful of agents and one or two vehicles. \n\nThis is why activists were blocking roads, to keep out the dozens of vehicles trying to overtake a neighborhood. \n\nPretti's murder was on par with what the free world supposedly stands against, the World was shocked, even some of the right's hard core support. THAT is why they backed off and tried to divert blame, but these orders came from the top, make no mistake. ",

There will be locations where it won\u2019t be safe\u2026 that\u2019s just a fucked up part of the reality we\u2019re in. \n\nThe idea is that the scared voters that come out because they know it\u2019s safe will help make up for districts where the vote is suppressed. Smaller local races will get skewed, but something is better than having big chunks of voters across a lot of areas stay home because they\u2019re scared. \n\nICE only has about 22k enforcers. Yes, they\u2019re pulling any enforcement from other departments, but still! [This source](https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/document_library/files/EAVSDeepDive_pollworkers_pollingplaces_nov17.pdf) says there were about 116k polling locations in the US in 2016\u2019s election. We\u2019ve seen that ICE likes to travel in packs. If they go 20 agents per location they could only cover 1% of polling locations. The chance they\u2019ll be in a given area will be fairly low.\n\nYes they\u2019re gonna target polling locations in areas with lots of non-whites in cities, and will try to bring in as much LEO, national guard, and military as they can\u2026 but there are only so many places they can be.\n\nFor states like Texas with early voting, that\u2019s even more important to have a watch - because you have more options on places to vote (not restricted to your home polling location), and it\u2019s more time that ICE has to spread out resources to cover.",

If there are 20 ice agents, then show up with a crowd of 100+ peacefully asserting their right to vote. Close ranks against the agents. They\u2019re cowards at heart. Yes, it is risky. Yes it is dangerous - less than lethal munitions, tear gas, smoke bombs and pepper spray will be used against peaceful voters. But they can\u2019t stop everyone.

        "body": "First of all, US elections already have multiple layers of protection in place to prevent widespread election tampering.\n\nSeveral safeguards, legal deterrents, eligibility requirements, audits and paper trails already exist and act as very effective measures against voter and election fraud.\n\nProof of citizenship requirements also exist and ID verification is already required in several states.\n\nUp till now, these measures have acted as an effective deterrent to fraud, but ever since Trump began denying elections without proof and lying to his voters so he could conspire to overturn the results of a free and fair election, those same voters have been pushing for needless policies that seek to address a fictional problem.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly indicated their intention to suppress the vote through multiple measures designed to make the voting process more challenging or meticulous for those that vote against them. \n\nIn other countries, election/voting laws and polling procedures often make voting simpler and more convenient, but in the US, republican-backed voting laws, regulations and challenges tend to make it more difficult to vote\u2014especially for citizens located in urban areas and cities\n\nRepublicans have been steadily suppressing the vote for years; an effort accelerated in the aftermath of January 6th and by Trump's 'big lie\" of a stolen election.\n\nTo make matters worse, Trump has been federalizing the military and law enforcement, while deputizing trigger happy and unaccountable ICE thugs in order to centralize authoritarian control over US cities and urban areas; a paramilitary presence he now openly plans to utilize to suppress the vote in upcoming elections.\n\nThe GOP has seized on this post Jan 6 environment to sow distrust in our elections. They have piggybacked off Trump's lies of election fraud; tapping into a stockpile of conspiracy theories, lies, and misinformation to dissuade and deceive the public, and to carry out a nationwide campaign of disenfranchisement and voter suppression.\n\nRepublicans continue to exploit the misinformed. They've taken advantage of the ignorance, the partisanship and the mindless distrust of their voters to give themselves the legal authority to challenge election results while granting their party more power, control and supervision over our election system.\n\nThey have the capability now to deny, subvert, legally contest and overturn future elections with near impunity.\n\nRepublicans are consolidating power at an alarming rate; abusing their trifecta and their control over state legislatures to give themselves the ultimate say on how maps are drawn; unilaterally deciding who their voters are and not the other way around.\n\nThis brazen mid-census redistricting effort would also not be possible without Trump giving himself and his party a license to say f-ck all to democratic norms for the sake of maintaining their grip on power.\n\nOn top of all of this, Republicans are trying to scheme their way through the courts to dilute the minority vote by challenging section 2 of the voting Rights Act. A historically significant provision meant to protect voters from being unfairly sequestered and disenfranchised.\n\nRepublicans have the gall to say they're \"protecting the integrity of elections,\" while making every effort to subvert the vote, crudely redraw maps, limit voter participation, alter the census in their favor, reshape districts along racial lines, and influence election outcomes.\n\nRepublicans have all but succeeded at diverting attention away from their continued efforts to erode the democratic process.\n\nThey have also been scapegoating immigrants and marginalized communities of people who they urge you to blame the nation's problems on; including manufactured issues like rampant \"voter fraud.\"\n\nAs far as \"voter ID\" goes, the Republican party's obsession with enacting voter ID laws is nothing short of a deception.\n\nWhen it comes to \"protecting the integrity of our elections,\" voter ID is at the bottom of the list. \n\nRepublicans will tell you that voter ID policy is backed by bipartisan support, but what they won't tell you is that they advocate for strict requirements which would exclude most basic forms of ID.\n\nAmericans support using these basic forms of ID to vote, but there is no data showing support for narrower requirements. This is because these requirements would act as an obstacle, not a preventative measure.\n\nWhat's really disingenuous about this whole campaign is that voter ID is not the only policy Republicans want to enact. Give them the chance and they will seize on it to roll back voting rights and impose widespread restraints. Voter ID just becomes a smokescreen and this is a compelling reason for obstructing their poorly disguised efforts to suppress the vote.\n\nAdditionally, ID requirements exist in other countries because obtaining IDs in these countries is easier and voting is more accessible. Governments also automatically issue IDs to citizens in many countries where ID is required to vote. \n\nRepublicans often argue against the use of basic forms of ID and automatic ID issuance. Ask yourself why Republicans clamor on and on for voter ID requirements, yet push back against policies that would help make voter ID a reality? \n\nAnd if all of that wasn't enough, other systemic issues exist that act as impediments to free and fair elections.\n\nAnalyses show that when states have fair maps, drawn by independent commissions, representation is more evenly split\u2014especially in Republican controlled states where Democrats gain seats when they otherwise wouldn't due to partisan redistricting efforts. When those same states are gerrymandered to hell, Republicans win more seats. \n\nRepublicans also tend to be overrepresented in state legislatures, meaning they have broader control of gerrymandering.\n\nThe GOP is capitalizing on this opportunity to consolidate power for the foreseeable future. Which means that their redistricting wars and voter suppression efforts will be ongoing, and the more this continues, the more it will chip away at the democratic process.\n\nIn order to address this, gerrymandering practices must be eliminated, and redistricting must be left up to independent commissions in every state.\n\nThe Citizens United ruling and our campaign finance system are also major obstacles standing in the way of free and fair elections.\n\nThe rich and corporations have disproportionate control over the outcomes of our elections and far too much political influence. What's needed to address these problems are:\n\n1. A complete overhaul of how our elections and candidate's campaigns are funded.\n\n2. Significant campaign finance reforms that necessitate 100% transparency, publicly funded campaigns and predominant grassroots support, and\nmassive regulations on Super PACs, lobbyists and political advocacy groups.\n\n3. An end to Citizens United. \n\nWe must also address foreign election interference efforts and the Republican party's failure to confront this pressing issue because they have benefitted politically from foreign election meddling for the last several elections.\n\nThat said, if MAGA is genuinely intent on \"protecting the integrity of our elections\" and the democratic process, they should turn their attention to the myriad systemic issues that Donald Trump and the Republican party are hell bent on preserving instead of obsessing over unsubstantiated conspiracy theories from five years ago.\n\nBut they won't... Instead they are fixated on this imaginary issue because that's precisely what those deciding our elections want from them.",

ICE is controlled by the executive branch, so the president. This means the president can order them to do things, and they will likely comply, especially if they were hired as supporters of his. Likewise, all the shit DOGE did was in agencies that, you guessed it, are controlled by the president, so he could order those agencies to cooperate, fire or pressure to resign those who didn't, and that type of thing.\n\nThe president does not control elections. The states do. Cancelling the election, legally speaking, would require the state legislature to pass a bill cancelling it. But we're not concerned with legal, so let's say the state's Secretary of State, the position most likely to control elections in a state, unilaterally, maybe with support of the governor, illegally cancels the election. Now what? If you thought whoever holds the seat keeps the seat, wrong! Now with the election cancelled, the state has no representative in Congress next session. The seat is vacant. So even if it's a Republican in charge, and Trump pressures them to cancel elections, do you think the state wants to do this? Oh hell no.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the blowback from the populace. You think Minneapolis is disatrous for this administration? That'll look like the community art walk compared to what would be unleashed if a state cancelled elections for their people. There's literally nothing in it for the state government or state officials. It all reduces their power if they go along.\n\n*Elections are not being cancelled. It's not happening.*\n\nPutting ICE outside (or saying they will) to intimidate voters, or pull other election shenanigans *is the plan.* Because that's what the federal government is actually capable of doing. And that's bad enough. Though as others have noted, I suspect it will backfire as it galvanizes more people to vote. Again, when you try to intimidate people or take their rights away, look to Minneapolis to see what happens.",

The constitution is crystal clear on when the elections happen, and exactly when power transfers.\n\n\nWhat they can do, however, is encourage Republican governors to station their states' national guard around poll stations to harass/arrest anyone not voting correctly (or the wrong color, or have an accent, or \"look like ANTIFA\", whatever). Not only will this reduce the number of votes (which, usually, higher voter turnout = higher Democrat wins), but it will discourage people from coming to the polls to vote.\n\n\nFor Blue states Trump's admin will station ICE around poll stations for similar effect, but without having to nationalize Blue state NG (which they've lost the right to do so in court multiple times).\n\n\nIt's all a bit of a moot point, though. The Supreme Court has decided that only Congress can hold Trump accountable by impeaching and voting to remove him. Well, if he does a bunch of illegal shit to steal the election for the Republicans, to the degree where Congress maintains a Republican majority... then no one can hold him accountable, because the only people that *could* hold him accountable are on his side.\n\n\nIf he's able to steal the election - for himself, mind you - and the Supreme Court decides \"hey the 22nd amendment says you can't be president again\" - Trump can say \"Okay, cool, but I won the election and I am president. What're you gonna do about it? Congress says I'm the president, and they're the only ones that could vote to remove me.\"\n\n\nI think that's where we're heading.

ICE can attack urban districts in these states freely with the approval of the governors and local police, ensuring victories.

Democratic governors in states that Trump could target have been huddling with their teams to game out how to handle potential interference from the White House.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe have to plan to safeguard the ballots and ballot equipment against federal seizure. We have to plan for the potential specter of armed, masked men roaming our streets and scaring people away from the polls,\u201d said Shenna Bellows, Maine\u2019s secretary of state who is running in the Democratic primary for governor.1\n\n&gt;The Democratic National Committee also created a new litigation department last year in preparation for election challenges. They\u2019ve spent much of the past year building out a team of volunteer lawyers across the country and have been making contingency plans for problems that could arise in the leadup to or on election day.\n\n&gt;Some of these are steps that the DNC and its allies took in prior cycles. But what is different now is that no one is treating them as just boxes to check. Nor do they view the threat as theoretical. After the 2020 elections and January 6th, Democratic officials understand the stakes and are approaching voter protection and election interference with deep consternation\u2014which has influenced both the resources they\u2019re putting into this year\u2019s election and the ways they\u2019re talking about it.",

He said 427 had been filed in January alone, and that the pace is expected to continue into February.\n\n&gt;\u201cTo respond to this wave of habeas petitions, this Office has been forced to shift its already limited resources from other pressing and important priorities,\u201d Rosen said in a declaration to the court. \u201cThe MN-USAO has cancelled all [civil enforcement] work and any other affirmative priorities and is operating in a reactive mode.\u201d\n\n&gt;In a filing accompanying Rosen\u2019s statement, Justice Department attorneys emphasized that the \u201ccrushing burden\u201d caused by immigration cases had led U.S. attorneys offices to \u201cshift resources away from other critical priorities, including criminal matters.\u201d\n\n&gt;Rosen, a Trump appointee confirmed by the Senate in October 2025, said his team of attorneys handling civil litigation is \u201cdown 50%\u201d \u2014 a reference to a wave of resignations and departures at the start of Operation Metro Surge \u2014 and that those who remain \u201care appearing daily for hearings on contempt motions.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Court is setting deadlines within hours, including weekends and holidays. Paralegals are continuously working overtime. Lawyers are continuously working overtime,\u201d Rosen lamented, saying the court\u2019s quick ruling is \u201cdesperately needed.\u201d\n\n&gt;Rosen\u2019s admissions contradict claims by the Department of Homeland Security that the flood of immigration cases filed in federal court has not overtaxed the Justice Department. A spokesperson said Wednesday that the administration is \u201cmore than prepared to handle the legal caseload\u201d caused by the mass deportation effort.\n\nThe DOJ [just fired someone](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/prosecutor-immigration-outburst.html) for making similar claims.",

Her disagreements emerge only in private, in conversations with top White House officials and cabinet secretaries, whose numbers are all saved in her phone.\n\nOver the last year, Ms. Britt has occasionally convinced the Trump administration to reverse course, according to several people with knowledge of conversations between Ms. Britt and Trump officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe those interactions. A call to the Pentagon restored the training materials on the Black airmen from Alabama, the people said. A call to the White House got Mr. Trump on board with funding body-worn cameras for ICE agents. And a call to Mr. Trump directly restored billions of dollars for research last summer to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nDemocratic senators are well aware of Ms. Britt\u2019s ability to make these calls, several of them said. They regularly rely on her to take their concerns to the White House in an era when the administration rarely reaches across the aisle.\"\n\n(This article is really long. Summary is Katie Britt says she feels really bad about what ICE is doing to kids, but she's waffling on actually criticizing ICE or Trump.)",

Targeted enforcement DHS officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant. End indiscriminate arrests and improve warrant procedures and standards. Require verification that a person is not a US citizen before holding them in immigration detention.\n2. No masks Prohibit ICE and immigration enforcement agents from wearing masks and other face coverings.\n3. Require ID Require DHS officers conducting immigration enforcement to display their agency, unique ID number and last name. Require them to verbalize their ID number and last name if asked.\n4. Protect sensitive locations Prohibit funds from being used to conduct enforcement near sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, childcare facilities, churches, polling places, courts etc.\n5. Stop racial profiling Prohibit DHS officers from conducting stops, questioning and searches based on an individual\u2019s presence a certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race or ethnicity.\n\n[*You can read the full list for free at this link.*](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/05/democrats-ice-reforms-funding-bill?referring_host=Reddit&amp;utm_campaign=guardianacct)",

Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, released an expanded list of 10 detailed proposals on Wednesday night for restraining President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign of immigration enforcement. Among the demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use of force standards and a stop to racial profiling.\n\n&gt;Thune, R-S.D., said most of the demands are \u201cvery unrealistic and unserious\u201d and he called on Democrats to negotiate.\n\n&gt;*\u201cThis is not a blank check situation where Republicans just do agree to a list of Democrat demands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to get reforms to ICE is to agree to a bill.\u201d*\n\n&gt;Schumer, D-N.Y., said he is \u201castounded to hear\u201d Republicans say his party\u2019s proposals were political or unworkable.\n\n&gt;*\u201cIt\u2019s about people\u2019s basic rights, it\u2019s about people\u2019s safety,\u201d Schumer said. If Republicans do not like the ideas, he said, \u201cthey need to explain why.\u201d*\n\n\n&gt;As the two parties traded blame, a DHS shutdown appeared increasingly likely, starting Feb. 14. As of now, Thune said, \u201cwe aren\u2019t anywhere close to having any sort of an agreement.\u201d\n\n&gt;In addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said, \u201cthere\u2019s a very good chance we could see more travel problems\u201d similar to the 43-day government closure last year.",

Yes  these people are trying everything they can to rig it, but there are signs that this will blow up in their face. Take the recently gerrymandered House seats in Texas for example. These seats were gerrymandered under the assumption that republicans would maintain the same share of the latino and young male vote that they got in 2024. However if you look into the results of the recent special election in Texas, latinos and young men massively swung from red to blue, which resulted in a democrat winning by 14 points in a district that trump won by 17 points. If that election is an indication, then Texas is set to lose more House seats to the dems than they would have otherwise if they didn't try to gerrymander their maps. Gotta love the irony. ",

Did you know that the Diet was never closed during WW2 except temporarily to shelter from bombing?  Besides having to join an umbrella national party, \"opposition\" represenitives were allowed to continue to hold their seats, attempt to pass legislation, and vote against what Japan was doing the entire time all the way through 1945.  \n\nThis was allowed because doing so was useless.  It gave people a pressure valve to vent through.  A false voice that couldn't effect meaningful change because the military wasn't beholden to the Diet and it could be reshuffled any number of times if it looked like it was close to having a meaningful moment.  Socialists and Communists had long been arrested, so all that was left were middle of the road corprotists who profited directly from Japanese expansion and resource extraction operations (that often were detrimental to Japan' war effort, putting profit over strategic efficiency).  \n\nSo as a Japanese citizen you would be pissed about being cold, hungry, having your son's fight a useless war they were losing, cast their vote for someone who claimed they would fix it, they would win, get into office, make some useless speech about really supporting the Emperor by demanding a change in the course of the war for the sake of the people, and then absolutely fuck all would happen.  And they knew fuck all would happen, because they would go back to their comfortable estate away from the city, away from the bombing zones, and privately discuss how they would survive the war as it got worse while millions starved.\n\nAnd they did.  The party that dominates Japan's current politics, the Libreal Democratic Party, is full to the brim with the descendants of these guys.  There was a moment shortly after the war where actual resistance members held control, but America cut deals with former zaibatsu members to jump start Japan's industrial capacity during the Korean War and they shuffled right back into the same seats and sliced a piece of Japan right back up for themselves.  Look at what is going on in Japan now.  A right wing nationalist movement with connections to Putin is blaming everything on immigration and stealing everything not bolted down, same as here.\n\nThese people are a core part of the disease.  We have to remove them too to really solve the problem.",

ICE operations would continue even in the event of a shutdown of the rest of DHS.

And just like he did last time, Trump will just wait it out, let things rot to shit for as long as it takes until people affected by the travel disruptions start putting pressure on Schumer and purple state senators to cave.

They are immune to optics. There is \\*\\*NOTHING\\*\\* Trump could do that would turn them against him.

            "body": "They have already been trying to do that. Trump said just days ago he'll be halting funding to sanctuary cities. He has [tried to pass bills](https://www.nilc.org/articles/this-bill-would-slash-city-and-state-funding-for-not-facilitating-mass-deportations/) to do it since the start of his term. If he's hellbent on doing it either way, might as well fight back however you can.\n\nEdit: [\u201cSanctuary\u201d Jurisdictions: Legal Overview](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11321) from congress.gov.\n\n&gt;Considerations for Congress\n\n&gt;Congress has options if it decides to address \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction laws and policies relating to federal immigration enforcement. Several bills introduced in the House and Senate in the 119th Congress would seek to deter \"sanctuary\" policies, including by limiting jurisdictions' ability to receive federal funds (see, e.g., No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act \\[[H.R. 32](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/32/text)\\], HELD Act \\[[H.R. 1821](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1821/text)\\], Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act \\[[S. 685](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/685/text)\\], No DOT Funds for Sanctuary Cities Act \\[[H.R. 4565](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4565/text/ih?overview=closed&amp;format=xml)\\]). Other bills introduced in the 119th Congress would directly or tangentially address \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction policies. The UPLIFT Act ([H.R. 1680](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1680?s=1&amp;r=6)) would, among other things, amend and expand the existing federal detainer statute and bar restrictions on state and local LEAs' ability to share information about aliens who are suspected of criminal activity with federal immigration officials. Still other bills would alter \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions' eligibility for federal benefits and services. The Save SBA from Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025 ([H.R. 2931](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2931/text)) passed the House on June 5, 2025, and would, among other things, relocate certain offices of the Small Business Administration in \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. The No Student Visas for Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025 ([H.R. 3237](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3237/text)) would limit student visas for institutions in \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. The No Tax Breaks for Sanctuary Cities Act ([H.R. 1879](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1879/text)) would deny tax-exempt status for bonds issued by \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. This\u00a0[In\u00a0Focus](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11438)\u00a0provides a list of additional past proposed legislation introduced in the 118th Congress.",

Still owned by a billionaire and fuck billionaires, but at least the AEW billionaire (Tony Khan) allows his performers to have fucking opinions.\n\nThe administration never lost AEW fans because they never really had them to begin with. Wrestlers at AEW are allowed to share their own views, and Brody King (the guy in the clip) wore an Abolish ICE shirt early into the crackdown at a televised show and raised [$60k](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fa3ulcxe99khg1.png) that he donated to Minnesota. Wrestlers there have regularly [supported trans causes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/zauf2m/kenny_omega_showing_support_for_the_transgender/), and the company had a trans womens champion where the fact that she was trans really wasn't a part of her character.\n\nWWE is conservative as hell, but please don't paint all of us with the same brush just because WWE fans love inhaling Trump farts (or more accurately the crowd noise the WWE pipes in over the actual arena audio).\n\nEdit: If you have HBO Max, the broadcast is up from last night. It was a pretty fuckin' good show and I'd honestly recommend the full thing. The chants are during the main event, so you can skip to the last 15 minutes to get to that part of it if you just want to see it.\n\nEdit 2: [Here's the match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl9FFpmatPI). It was a squash. MJF (the guy in the ring) was distracted by [Hangman Adam Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NlNDrUeAsU), the anxious millennial cowboy (and real life retired school teacher), allowing Brody King (The Abolish ICE guy) to lock in the sleeper, guaranteeing him a title shot at Grand Slam Australia on February 14th.",

Public rape was used as a punishment against male slaves by slave masters. The same masters that used the Christian bible and religion to control the minds of slaves.

        "body": "Want to hear some other wrestling related bits of criticism for Trump and ICE? These ones are from the WWE orbit, though, so they arent as obvious. Batista and Punk regularly re-tweet anti Trump rhetoric or protests. The night before the first No Kings protest Punk was performing in Lexington, KY and still booked a red-eye (or drove I guess) to be in Chicago for it. Brie Bella of the Bella Twins recently shared quotes from Alex Petti. Becky Lynch did an in-character bit where she declared that she \"hates ice\" because it \"gets people killed\" but since her current character is a satire of Trump it's hard to say it loud and proud. Lynch HAS worn Palestinian colors to the ring while carrying a WWE belt and made substantial donations to Palestinian relief. Sami Zayn also wears Palestinian colors full time, though that same set of colors is on the Syrian flag and he's Syrian-Canadian so it may be coincidental. Mick Foley has refused to make Legend appearances while Trump in office and will not renew his contract while Trump is in power.\n\n\nCharlotte Flair and Chelsea Green have been vocal leftists for a while. Cody Rhodes hasn't made this clear in a bit but he's confirmed that he was anti-MAGA during the 2020 election cycle, and did what he could to advocate for black women in AEW. (And seemingly WWE?) Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch have marched with Black Lives Matter. Cena and the Rock both have a good track record for supporting queer rights, though they have somewhat thornier political situations.\n\n\nThere's more of a mix among wrestlers than you expect is what I'm getting at. And there's a few far right dickheads like Undertaker, Kane, Dustin Rhodes/Goldust, and Chris Jericho.",

Videos of them arresting regular ass working people, cooks, janitors, housekeepers, laborers, factory workers, etc. children, native Americans, literal US citizens. My own father said this shit to me, I grew up with the guy, I don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body because of the way he raised me, never heard any racism out of his mouth my entire life, that is up until maybe 10 years ago I began to slowly hear things come out of my families mouths that I never dreamed I would ever hear from them. I don\u2019t think my family were always bad people and were just keeping it quiet, I think they probably had some minor questionable opinions on certain things but were generally decent people, but over the last 10 or 15 years I\u2019ve watched them slowly become radicalized, bit by bit. Their minor opinions and biases and fears were targeted and nurtured and stoked slowly over time until they\u2019ve become people that they didn\u2019t used to be.

Stop pretending like democrats are ever going to attempt to reduce ice funding when they keep telling us over and over again they don\u2019t support that.

I have worked in the clinic for two years in a row I personally saw the change under this admin\n\n\n\nBy not voting you\u2019re allowing more people to suffer. Trump is in no way better on Palestine. No one as saved by not voting. Instead I had to watch a forever disabled afghan asylee who was shot by the Taliban for helping America cry to me in front of his children begging me to explain why the green cards he waited for was suddenly rejected.  I had to watch him wail in front of me that he and his family would be murdered if they were sent back and his children started crying\n\n\nI had to explain to a man from Eritrea that he could no longer safely apply to extend his work visa because ice was now sending people to third world countries that had no rules about sending refugees and asylees back to a country where they will be executed and Eritrea has a history of executing people who escape. This was all because 15 years ago he used drugs despite having been clean for years and being adamant about keeping up with his treatment\n\n\nI had to tell a fellow Iranian he\u2019d likely now be deported because a canvasser decided to sign his name on a voting application when he didn\u2019t understand English. \n\n\n\nI can\u2019t fucking stand hearing this nonsense. They weren\u2019t suffering in this manner before Trump. Things are so much worse for the most vulnerable and I have to hear the most privileged people say what you\u2019re saying because it doesn\u2019t impact you, while I have to worry everyday for my undocumented best friend because daca no longer matters or my Iranian family members who escaped hell but could not pass their citizenship test yet, just stop man",

Targeted Enforcement \u2013 DHS officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant; end indiscriminate arrests; improve warrant procedures and standards; require verification that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention.\n\n2. No Masks \u2013 Prohibit ICE and immigration enforcement agents from wearing face coverings.\n\n3. Require ID \u2013 Require DHS officers conducting immigration enforcement to display their agency, unique ID number and last name; require them to verbalize their ID number and last name if asked.\n\n4. Protect Sensitive Locations \u2013 Prohibit funds for enforcement near medical facilities, schools, child care facilities, churches, polling places, courts and other sensitive locations.\n\n5. Stop Racial Profiling \u2013 Ban stops, questioning and searches based on presence at certain locations, jobs, spoken language, accent, race or ethnicity.\n\n6. Uphold Use of Force Standards \u2013 Codify reasonable use-of-force policy, expand training and require officer certification; remove officers from the field pending investigations after incidents.\n\n7. Ensure State and Local Coordination and Oversight \u2013 Preserve state and local authority to investigate potential crimes and excessive force; require evidence preservation and sharing; require consent of states and localities for large-scale operations outside targeted enforcement.\n\n8. Build Safeguards into the System \u2013 Require immediate access to attorneys in detention; allow states to sue DHS for violations; prohibit limits on member visits to ICE facilities regardless of funding source.\n\n9. Body Cameras for Accountability, Not Tracking \u2013 Mandate body-worn cameras and establish storage/access rules; prohibit tracking or databases of individuals engaged in First Amendment activities.\n\n10. No Paramilitary Police \u2013 Regulate and standardize uniforms and equipment to align with civil enforcement.\n\n\nNot in the article and is missing from the 10 demands: \n\n1. Resignation and/or prosecution of everyone who gave unconstitutional orders and committed illegal actions. \n\n2. No more unlawful abductions.\n\n3. Allow inspection of facilities by lawmakers.\n\nEdit: instead of making demands,  why not competely pull the plug on ICE by not funding them at all?  We know ICE acts similar to Hitlers fascist thugs,  so just abolish ICE. NO MORE FUNDING ICE!",

But mainly they just enjoyed attacking anyone perceived as an enemy. Nobody would think of them as a legitimate part of the government, or think that they were trying to \u201cenforce immigration law\u201d\n\nIf they were a federal agency, ICE would (among other things) obey court orders, as opposed to deliberately and willfully violating hundreds of court orders. No, they\u2019re a paramilitary group pretending to be part of the government\u00a0",

They don't hear the stories we hear, they don't see the pictures we see, they aren't given the facts we're given. You can say that they are *choosing* to stick their heads in the sand by watching nothing but Fox News. But go check out the stories posted on the conservative sub and tell me if you would take the time to read them and give them due consideration as being truthful. You probably wouldn't. The picture they paint is so far from the reality you know that you immediately dismiss them out of hand. That's what Fox viewers experience when they read articles from neutral or leftwing sources. The gulf between the realities is so big, it feels uncrossable. So they don't cross. So they draw conclusions and opinions from skewered and sanitized information.\n\nI truly believe most people aren't evil. They protect themselves and their families from what they see as a threat, just as we all do. But we could not be more different in what we consider a threat, based on our experiences and out information. Acknowledging this - that most people aren't \"bad\" even if they still support trump, but that they do not share a reality with us - is going to be vital in bridging that gulf and resetting the definitions of \"reality\" so this doesn't happen again.",

Require them to verbalize their ID number and last name if asked.\n\n&gt;4. **Protect Sensitive Locations** \u2013 Prohibit funds from being used to conduct enforcement near sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, child-care facilities, churches, polling places, courts, etc.\n\n&gt;5. **Stop Racial Profiling** \u2013 Prohibit DHS officers from conducting stops, questioning and searches based on an individual\u2019s presence at certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race and ethnicity.\n\n&gt;6. **Uphold Use of Force Standards** \u2013 Place into law a reasonable use of force policy,expand training and require certification of officers. In the case of an incident, the officer must be removed from the field until an investigation is conducted.\n\n&gt;7. **Ensure State and Local Coordination and Oversight** \u2013 Preserve the ability of State and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute potential crimes and use of excessive force incidents. Require that evidence is preserved and shared with jurisdictions. Require the consent of States and localities to conduct large-scale operations outside of targeted immigration enforcement.\n\n&gt;8. **Build Safeguards into the System** \u2013 Make clear that all buildings where people are detained must abide by the same basic detention standards that require immediate access to a person\u2019s attorney to prevent citizen arrests or detention. Allow states to sue DHS for violations of all requirements. Prohibit limitations on Member visits to ICE facilities regardless of how those facilities are funded.\n\n&gt;9. **Body Cameras for Accountability, Not Tracking** \u2013 Require use of body-worn cameras when interacting with the public and mandate requirements for the storage and access of footage.

Why should democrats wait for the system to fail to start demanding better? It's the natural lifecycle of bureaucracy.

Those polls rely on assumptions about voter turnout / makeup that often dont align with reality.  Very few polls in 2024 had Trump doing so well with Latinos, for example.  \n\nSo if Trump team sees a D+2 environment in their polling, they'll project that onto the map and pick the races where a little ratfuckery might tip the balance to R+1.  If the reality of election day is a D+5 environment those races are inconsequential as the D advantage holds in those ratfucked races, and a whole host of *other* races would have actually been more optimal to ratfuck but weren't.  Now those races are lost as well because no one was around to intimidate voters\n\nBasically, ratfucking races through intimidation tactics is a lot harder than it sounds  when resources are limited to ICE goons",

This is not new with Donald Trump and Donald's opponents have been slow to acknowledge such stealing. It is still not widely understood that Donald stole the 2016 and 2024 elections, but people are aware that Donald tried to overthrow the government in the election in-between where truly massive cheating didn't deliver the goods.\n\nAnd all that went down in those years between: voter suppression, purging, paperless voting machines, gerrymandering, more fake felons' lists, CrossCheck, more machine problems in certain districts, more lost motor voter rolls, more general restrictions, overturning huge parts of the legendary Voting Rights Act, etc.\n\nThere was that incident where the state of Texas redistricted mid-decade. That was in 2005. Today, pundits say that the current mid-decade redistricting is unprecedented. Did they forget what happened twenty years earlier?\n\nWe are still not there. We still do not have enough attention on the election stealing, even now as the issue has become more mainstream. When do we get there?",

In case you haven't noticed, our leadership has historically had a habit of collapsing like a house of cards with the slightest breeze.  \n\nThen you've got Trump's presidential pardons to worry about, which he is 100% going to hand out like Halloween candy if/when he leaves office.  \n\nThen you've got statute of limitations issues to worry about.  Any investigation is 3 years away at a minimum.  SOL for many of these crimes is as little as 5 years.   Between the investigation time and the time needed to hold all the trials, along with whatever they can do to gum up the works and stall out the clock, the statute of limitations on many of these crimes will lapse.  \n\nPromising to go after the rank-and-file ICE agents will just cause friends and families to vote hard R up and down the ticket in order to shield their loved ones from being prosecuted, making getting Democrats elected that much harder.  \n\nThe vast, vast majority of these people are going to get away with it.   Trump's pardon power and SCOTUS-blessed immunity alone virtually guarantee it.   A couple of cronies might get sacrificed along the way to protect the inner circle, but the pardons for those at the top have probably already been written.  \n\nIn fact, I'd be willing to bet Trump is dangling that over their heads to ensure continued loyalty -- stick with Trump and you're protected by his pardon power.  Fall out of favor and you'll be discarded and forced to answer for the crimes you committed in Trump's name.",

The guy who got pulled out of his house in his underwear last week? The actual \"target\" was someone else, and already in prison. You'd think their intel would have had that crucial bit of info.\n2. Prisons STAY stacked. It's better for the system to jail a person for literally anything than simply rehabbing them. Can't pay your debt? Minor non-violent infraction? Victimless crime?

        "body": "&gt;Leading for-profit prison companies donated about half a million dollars to Republican members of Congress currently in office, and $58,000 to Democratic congressmembers, from 2021 through 2025, according to an investigation by The Appeal. Executives at these firms have also donated millions of dollars to candidates, political parties, and political action committees (PACs).\n\n&gt;More than 70,000 people are currently being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the majority of them are incarcerated in private prisons. Of the 38 people who died while in ICE custody, from 2025 through Feb. 1, 71 percent were held in for-profit facilities, according to data collected by lawyer and journalist Andrew Free.\n\n&gt;The Appeal has compiled information on every sitting member of Congress who has received donations from two of the largest private prison companies that contract with ICE \u2014 CoreCivic and GEO Group \u2014 along with the smaller Management &amp; Training Corporation (MTC). The Appeal reviewed hundreds of records published by OpenSecrets and the Federal Election Commission, and is publishing the results of its investigation in a searchable database. \n\n&gt;The Appeal\u2019s investigation revealed that:\n\n&gt;\u2014 Democratic Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-Georgia) and Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) each received a total of $21,000 in donations from private prison companies \u2014 more than any other sitting member of Congress. CoreCivic and MTC donated to Bishop; CoreCivic, GEO Group, and MTC donated to Cuellar. CoreCivic and GEO Group each operate facilities in Cuellar\u2019s district. \n\n&gt;\u2014 Two other Democrats also received donations from private prison companies. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi received a total of $10,000 from GEO Group and MTC, and MTC donated $5,000 to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. \n\n&gt;\u2014 From 2021 through 2025, GEO Group executive chairman George Zoley and former CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger each made political contributions totaling more than one million dollars, including donations to the Republican National Committee and to PACs affiliated with President Donald Trump. (Last year, CoreCivic announced that Hininger would be leaving the company.) \n\n&gt;\u2014 Over the same five-year period, GEO Group\u2019s PAC (Political Action Committee) outspent CoreCivic and MTC, donating more than $280,000 to current members of Congress. CoreCivic donated more than $248,000 while MTC donated more than $147,000.\n\n&gt;It appears their investments have paid off.\n\n&gt;Under President Trump, Congress has passed legislation to dramatically expand immigration detention and fund ICE at unprecedented levels, much to the delight of private prison executives.",

We are not living in a pre-Nixon fantasy land where the GOP are \"our friends on the other side of aisle\" no matter how badly the neo-liberal cowards who have hold the reins of power for the Democratic party want to pretend. \n\nWe've long since passed a point where it is pathetic at best and traitorous at worst to ever presume the GOP ever works in good faith. They've openly announced multiple times an agenda which is blatantly anti-American and they view politics as a zero sum game, one where they will do absolutely anything to win. \n\nThat they've not completely destroyed the country yet isn't due to lack of trying but that they've got a low level cunning which owes it's success primarily due to the brute force of wealth. The only thing these enemies of humanity understand is subjugation, inflicting it on others (as they're doing right now, starting with the most vulnerable) or having it done to them. \n\nBasically unless a strong political coalition is formed among the opposition party things will not improve in any capacity. And if they want to keep riding the fence when it comes to fascism (as they've done an impressive job of doing this last year, even having some fun PR person write mean tweets in a childish attempt to come off as \"serious\" while also shaking hands with authoritarians/corporate interests) it will be up to the people to handle it, which will result in a lot of unnecessary destruction.",

Every single one of them is what I described (the fair weather voter who is drastically under informed on even basic government functions) and all mentioned how impressive The Wall is. A few even insisted Mexico did pay for it! \n\nThey don't engage in conversation like this because they're willing to learn and expand their knowledge. Nope they just want to hammer others over the head with how \"their team\" is winning despite all evidence to the contrary.  Anymore I don't bother and just try to direct the discussion to how greedy and corrupt the ultra wealthy are, they love that topic and agree with that sentiment.

Last year's escalation by trump and Stephen Miller have nothing to do with enforcing immigration laws. The organizations became a tool for trump and Miller to terrorize blue cities and traffick millions of people. Masked thugs in combat gear, violent abductions and murders, $170 billion in funding plus the goal of hiring an additional 10,000 thugs, all have nothing to do with immigration laws. Immigration is just the pretext. Terrorism is the objective: Violence directed towards civilians for political reasons.\n\nI don't think they will be used as poll watchers. It seems clear that trump will rig the elections and/or ignore the results, and ICE and Border Patrol will be used to wage war on the inevitable protests.\n\n\\*It's important to include Border Patrol in these conversations, as they are the worst of the bunch.

To the original point of the similarities to what Bannon is saying, what Jones was *actually* saying was \"Israel needs to be less indiscriminate in their bombing in Gaza... [because the World Economic Forum, Yuval Noah Harari, and the Democrats will import every military aged male in Gaza as a refugee, give them guns on arrival, and have the patrol polling stations to steal the election from Trump].\"\n\nSo, basically, the very consistent \"every accusation is a confession\" move that you see from these fucks.

It\u2019s not ICE as a whole you hate, just one branch of it.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is often misunderstood because it is actually comprised of two distinct branches with very different missions. Most of the public's apprehension stems from Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which is the branch responsible for the arrest, detention, and deportation of individuals for immigration violations. \n\nHowever, the other half of the agency is Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which operates as a massive criminal investigative body. HSI focuses on dismantling transnational threats that have little to do with standard immigration status, such as human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, and child exploitation. Distinguishing between the two is key: while ERO handles the controversial \"ER\" (Enforcement and Removal) side, HSI serves as a vital tool against serious global crime.",

They also lead the charge against cybercrime and financial scams targeting the elderly, which are serious threats that exist completely outside of the political cycle or standard immigration enforcement. \n\nThe \"Epstein files\" might be what makes the news, but the core of their mission is quiet, vital investigative work against serious global crime.",

However, U.S. history suggests reforms (e.g., via Democrats) could mitigate this, avoiding total disaster. Without changes, risks include authoritarian entrenchment or chaotic dissolution \u2013 a \"bad end\" for society more than ICE itself.

From 2014 to 2017, the company had four different CEOs, followed by Beck himself. Months after Beck took the position, the company laid off over a fourth of its staff.

Where most people see the extrajudicial murder of US citizens, some people see scared and cornered ICE agents with no other option than to kill in self-defence. Where most people see blatant corruption in the highest echelons of government, some people see sound decision-making. It's always best to define your terms so everyone agrees on the basics. \n\nYou might even get people to agree with some of your assessments. The Daily Beast regularly and repeatedly gets slated in this sub for its asinine headlines, Newsweek is generally ridiculed for its blatant AI-generated slop about every new poll that comes out, the New York Times is heavily criticised for its shameful naivety in the run-up to the 2024 elections, just to name a few. See, it really isn't difficult at all to name publications. \n\nWhy you are so utterly unwilling and incapable of supporting your assertions is beyond me. Do you or do you not want to have a discussion about your opinions? And if not, then why are you posting here? \n\nFor the record, I don't think any sources should be banned from here, be they Breitbart or The Daily Worker. Each article posted here has to stand or fall on its own merits. There's no point living in a bubble without seeing what \"the other side\" is saying and how they are framing their arguments.",

                "body": "The reason this sub is more dominated by liberal and left leaning outlets is more of an issue of perception. Bots remotely post articles for news outlets, and those bots are trying to farm attention for advertisers and data brokers. Ergo, because this sub has a more liberal audience than conservative subs, bots will post articles with more liberal leanings here in order to farm attention. Bots do the same with conservative subs. If bots, or users , post less liberal news articles, it's often voted down because the audience here isn't tailored for conservative content. The same will happen in conservative subs. Ergo, bots, and users, are incentivised to post content that aligns with the political alignment of the sub. Posting conservative content in a sub that describes itself as a liberal sub for US news and politics is blatantly foolish for the same reason that posting liberal content in a sub that describes itself as a safe space for conservative commentary.\n\nIf you want more independent information, I'd advise you to seek out subs that have a more narrow focus. For example, I follow a bunch of privacy and tech focused subs, which share news articles about privacy and security issues that aren't widely spread here. The content there, as it is tailored to a privacy conscious audience, doesn't suffer from the same political biases that this sub suffers from.\n\nTl;Dr, if you don't like liberal biases don't post content in a _liberal_ sub.",

But the survey was done in the few days after Bovino was fired and the Trump admin made a lot of statements about moderating, so it would be interesting to know how many people basically agree with the protesters and approve of his response because they saw it as aligned with protesters\u2019 demands. \n\nIf you look at the detailed Minnesota questions a majority (60%ish) said ICE has gone too far, is using too much force, and is picking up people randomly off the street, so it would make sense if people approved of moderation. \n\nBut it\u2019s also funny that they made that stat the headline, because overall this is a pretty bad poll for Trump. His approval rating is declining, he\u2019s down on essentially every issue including the ones that are supposed to be his strongest (immigration and the economy), a large majority said the country is worse off since he became president, 51% said he\u2019s doing a worse job than Biden, and they found that Democrats are favored going into the midterms. \n\nAs someone else said, for the people in the MAGA media bubble, it\u2019s going to sting when reality pops the bubble.",

So they fixed their bayonettes and swung their balls over their shoulder and charged. Broke through the first line and held long enough that they were almost encircled but bought enough time for reinforcements to arrive so that they could do a fighting retreat. They lost all their battlefield commanders, the Unit commander and all but 3 of the captains. 47 killed, 121 wounded and 47 missing. \n\nIn the battle the 1st Minnesota lost 5 flag bearers where each new flag bearer would ditch their weapon to keep the flag flying. At the end 47 survivors rallied back to the general under the command of the senior most captain Nathan S. Messick. \n\nThe Confederate Brigadeer General Wilcox had this to say. \n\n*This stronghold of the enemy \\[i.e., Cemetery Ridge\\], together with his batteries, were almost won,* ***when still another line of infantry descended the slope in our front at a double-quick****, to the support of their fleeing comrades and for the defense of the batteries. Seeing this contest so unequal, I dispatched my adjutant-general to the division commander, to ask that support be sent to my men, but no support came.* ***Three several times did this last of the enemy's lines attempt to drive my men back, and were as often repulsed.*** *This struggle at the foot of the hill on which were the enemy's batteries, though so unequal, was continued for some thirty minutes. With a second supporting line, the heights could have been carried. Without support on either my right or left, my men were withdrawn, to prevent their entire destruction or capture. The enemy did not pursue, but my men retired under a heavy artillery fire, and returned to their original position in line, and bivouacked for the night, pickets being left on the pike*\n\n  \nby the end of the civil war the 1000 men of the 1st Minnesota, 286 were dead 609 wounded. with 2 medal of honor recipients, one for Private Marshall Sherman for capturing Virginia's 28th regiments colors, and another by corporal Henry O'Brien having been knocked out by a bullet to the head and later shot in the hand, repeatedly recovering the fallen colors of 1st Minnesota and carried a wounded union comrade back to the union lines\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st\\_Minnesota\\_Infantry\\_Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Minnesota_Infantry_Regiment)",

A government attorney responded that the federal government\u2019s system \"sucks.\"\n\n&gt;**What we know:**\n&gt;Julie Le, an attorney working on behalf of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, admitted in court Tuesday that the government is \"overwhelmed\" by the number of legal challenges coming out of Operation Metro Surge.\n\n&gt;Le appeared in court to explain why ICE has repeatedly failed to comply with court orders during the ongoing immigration operation in Minnesota.\n\n&gt;**What they're saying:**\n&gt;\"I am here to make sure the agency understands how important it is to comply with court orders,\" said Le, who became visibly emotional during the court hearing.\n\n&gt;While Le said procedures are being implemented to ensure ICE complies with court orders moving forward, she admitted it has been like pulling teeth and has required non-stop work in an already depleted office.\n\n&gt;\"I wish you would just hold me in contempt of court so I can get 24 hours of sleep,\" Le said. \"The system sucks, this job sucks, I am trying with every breath I have to get you what I need.\"\n\n&gt;U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell said he called Tuesday\u2019s hearing to remind ICE and other federal agencies they are not above the law.\n\nImagine requesting to be held in contempt just so you can get some sleep!",

The formation of DHS was founded xenophobic lies and propaganda. \n\nSome great budget highlights for '26:\n\n$107,300,000.00 to modernize the \"financial system\" \n\n$40,000,000.00 for \"Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology\" cause we all benefit from facial recognition programs.\n\n$3,800,000.00 to pay **10** Federal Protective Officers for the World Cup..\n\n$6,000,000.00 more for the World Cup and the 250th celebration they're planning for no fucking reason.\n\n$150,000,000.00 to renovate a base in Arizona that flies Predator drones\n\n$138,700,000.00 for \"Autonomous Integrated Surveillance Towers\" \n\n$137,000,000.00 to enable data access for AI models and expanding AI capabilities \n\n$122,900,000.00 to hire 450 new CBP officers. \n\nBut let's look at the really good stuff...just the ICE stuff\n\n$501,000,000.00 (half a billion dollars) for 50,000 concentration camp beds. \n\n$205,000,000.00 for deporting people \n\nAnd another cool $25,000,000.00 dollars to cover 'travel and overtime' for ICE agents for the World Cup.\n\nAnd the Secret Service get some goodies, too!\n\n$219,300,000.00 for upgrading all their stuff, including \"operational mission support projects supporting residence security\" \n\nAnother $24,600,000.00 for the World Cup for the SS and a cool $15,000,000 for them for the Winter Olympics.\n\nBut let's look at the savings! \n\nWe are going to save $524,400,000.00 by eliminating the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, the Stakeholder Engagement offices, and the International Affairs, and Bombing Prevention offices at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Amazingly, they would receive $1,400,000,000.00 budget increase just because, with nothing more noted than \"increase the security of critical networks\"\n\nThen we save $70,400,000.00 by getting rid of the National Risk Management Center. \n\nAnd of course, reducing spending on Election Security by a whopping $39,600,000.00. Specifically, they are eliminating the Election Security Advisors for 10 regions that liaise with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as slashing the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center. \n\nPlease, tell me what the FUCK about this \"all Americans need\"? \n\nIt is an office designed to enable the petty whims of our executive long before Republicans would nakedly steal control of the government. GWB gave us this Cabinet level department in a flurry of xenophobic bloodlust and paranoia they stoked. Fuck the DHS, abolish that bitch, too. Nothing in that agency that existed before needs to be in that portfolio (hello Coast Guard) and anything that's been invented since can probably be trashed or moved elsewhere.",

By taking the larger, more painful government shutdown off the table now, they've already shown their hand. \n\nAlso, the original Republican leverage worked because holding up *everything* (including food aid) created immediate, widespread pressure **on Democrats** to fold to avoid that harm. Now, that shared, urgent pressure is gone. \n\nAt the end of the day, the two-week fight over DHS on it's own is still going to be a low-stakes, isolated issue for most of the every-day public. The (righteous, justified) outrage over the Pretti/Good shootings is already dying down in the media and Democrats are going to face the same choice: fund DHS as-is or own a \"security\" shutdown.

These paramilitary tactical units behave not like local police, but instead like special forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, or other far-flung battlefields from the Forever Wars of the past quarter century.\n\nAmid the widespread, hostile confrontations with concerned citizens in Minneapolis, the unusually aggressive conduct of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s tactical teams have led to two killings: ICE SRT agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good on January 7, while CBP SRT agent Raymundo Gutierrez was [identified by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez) as one of the two masked feds who shot and killed Pretti.\n\nThe brutal tactics of SRT and BORTAC units seem to have spread into ICE and CBP as a whole. Over the last year, these DHS agencies have morphed into a masked, seemingly unaccountable force that detains children, separates families, blows open doors, snatches teachers and parents from schools and day care centers, and [kills unarmed protesters](https://www.wired.com/story/why-ice-can-kill-with-impunity/) who were [simply voicing dissent](https://www.wired.com/story/the-campaign-to-destroy-renee-good/) or [recording the mayhem](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-film-ice/). In [16 shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/27/ice-border-patrol-shootings-immigration-trump/) involving Department of Homeland Security personnel since July, none have faced state or federal charges, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRead the full story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/ice-cbp-srt-bortac-units-immigration-operations/](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-cbp-srt-bortac-units-immigration-operations/)",

We all knew that was ridiculous given that Super Bowl tickets cost almost $7,000 at a minimum.  Most people cannot afford that amount of money to watch a sporting event, and even less so for someone who is in the country illegally.  So the entire concept of doing ICE enforcement at one of the most expensive events in the entire country was ridiculous on its face.\n\nHowever, the actual question is whether or not ICE agents are going to be there at all, and if so, WHY?!  ICE has a specific role.  It's right there in the name.  They are not an event security force nor are they a police force.  So, if there are ICE agents there... WHY!?",

And two, even at face value this does not say that ICE will not be present or even that no operations will be run, it just disclaims that any operations will be \u2018surprise\u2019 operations.",

Who thinks a bunch of undocumented immigrants making minimum wage would pony up half their yearly salary to travel to the Super Bowl? Nobody. Who were they going to deport? Bad Bunny? He's American!\n\nBut this was going to be a way to promote the Brownshirts to the ultra-rich: have a lot of presence and showcase just how \"painless\" it is to deal with ICE, maybe even give them a shoutout during the game for \"making everyone safer\", have JD Vance and his retinue applaud, whatever. They'd also have the pick of the litter, getting the better looking agents, not the butterballs you see brutalizing people on videos from Minneapolis. Basically signal that - unless you are an undesirable - you have nothing to worry about!\n\nBut ICE's reputation is so shit right now, it would probably only make people uncomfortable to see ICE patrols around. There's also the concern of them using facial recognition software on everyone. So they pulled them out of the event.",

An ICE agents salary of 100k that you will never see a dime of? The right to not be murdered or deported to a black site? Well how will they sue if they are dead or disappeared? These people aren\u2019t even held accountable for the blatant murders they commit in the street of unarmed civilians and you really think suing is going to do something? Literally what the fuck will it do? \n\nGee golly whiz justice has been served! Thanks dems! Whatever else could someone in your position of power do!! Without the dems then Trump would be trying to do crazy stuff like nationalize elections, deport citizens to foreign country\u2019s, or sending his personal gestapo to murder civilians in the street in broad daylight! Good thing dems are here to hold the line of sanity!!! \n\n\n\nOh wait\u2026\u2026. Sorry best they can do is give you the small chance to sue for fuck all.",

Since that was passed last year, the number of sheriff's offices and police departments that have signed a formal agreement with ICE has skyrocketed.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, Republican lawmakers in the state are considering making that voluntary program involuntary as part of a bigger immigration package. Kentucky lawmakers are moving in the same direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;This year, Tennessee is piloting legislation made in partnership with Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and the White House.\n&gt;\n&gt;One of the policies would make it impossible for someone without legal status to buy a car, earn a nursing certificate or receive any government benefits. (Many government benefits are already off-limits to people living in the country illegally.) \"We're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail\" is how Cameron Sexton, the Republican Tennessee House speaker, explained it when announcing the legislation.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Indiana Senate last week passed a measure that would tighten requirements for local agencies, including universities, to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Last month, New Hampshire took a page out of Tennessee's book by banning sanctuary cities, meaning cities can't impede federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties.\n\nWith states\u2019 rights, as with many other actions by this administration, there is a gulf between what they say and what actually happens. For states that are aligned with what the president wants at any given moment, there are \u2018rights\u2019. For those opposing federal measures, there aren\u2019t. This should more rightfully be considered privileges.",

        "body": "The day after the second general strike in Minneapolis, the labor unions of Portland, Oregon, marched in solidarity. It was the warmest day that Portland had seen in a while, with sun peeking out from the clouds here and there. Many people had brought their entire families; not just older children, but toddlers in strollers and wagons, too. Some brought their dogs. The chants were typical: \u201cICE out of Portland\u201d and \u201cNo hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.\u201d But the children were so visible that City Councilor Mitch Green felt a slight twinge of awkwardness. \u201cThere\u2019s some other folks saying, you know, \u2018Fuck ICE,\u2019 but, like, there\u2019s children in front of me. I don\u2019t want to say the F-word, you know?\u201d\n\nBut that was very soon the least of his concerns, as tear gas engulfed the protest at approximately 4:30PM. He and other witnesses recalled hearing six loud bangs; a video posted on social media recorded eight, as well as countless smaller pops. At least eight arcs of smoke flew far over people\u2019s heads, as though aimed at the back of the crowd.\n\n\u201cI know they would do anything, that they would hurt people, that they\u2019ve murdered people and shot them in the back 10 times,\u201d said Cassie Broeker, a Portland resident who came to protest with friends. \u201cI know that intellectually. But I still did not expect them to gas a chill, friendly protest full of nurses and teachers and children and the elderly.\u201d\n\nRead more: [https://www.theverge.com/policy/872783/tear-gas-children-portland-ice-labor](https://www.theverge.com/policy/872783/tear-gas-children-portland-ice-labor)",

Reyes, a Biden-appointed judge in Washington, blocked the Trump administration's effort to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for more than 350,000 Haitians legally living in the United States. Her order prevents the policy from taking effect indefinitely.\n\nIn an 83-page decision, Judge Reyes sharply criticized the administration, stating that it failed to follow the required legal process, including assessing whether Haiti is safe for TPS recipients to return to. She emphasized that these immigrants live and work legally in the U.S. and pay taxes, noting that the administration ignored the reality that they \"already live here, and legally.\"\n\nThe ruling also halted plans by the Trump administration to deploy ICE agents to Haitian communities in states such as Ohio and Florida once TPS expired, with the goal of detaining and deporting individuals who would have lost their protected status.\n\nTL;DR: On February 2, 2026, U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Haitians. The ruling came just one day before the protections were scheduled to expire on February 3rd, 2026 (notice).",

They detained both Liam and his father, who had been bringing him home from school. While images of Liam surrounded by masked federal agents ignited a national firestorm, the father and son were moved to a processing facility in Texas for deportation. A federal judge ordered them to be freed, finding that there wasn\u2019t enough probable cause to detain them. The family had entered the U.S. legally and applied for asylum upon arrival.\n\n&gt;...",

This is the pinnacle of these athletes careers, and possibly would never get the opportunity to compete at this level ever again in their lives.\u00a0 These sports don't get stages like the world cup, the super bowl, world series, etc.\u00a0 This is where the absolute best appear for competition.\u00a0 The Olympics are what they have been dedicating years and years and years, even most of their lives, towards.\u00a0 To ask them to just give it up because of politics severely undermines everything they have worked for and sacrificed to get there.\u00a0 It's just silly to think they can or even should drop out.\u00a0 Of course they are faced with internal conflict, but this is their chance to give it their all, and use it as a platform to show the world, and other lost Americans, that Americans can still be good people.",

The Super Bowl halftime show won\u2019t help their anxiety.  \n  \nThe performance by Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican global music star and outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, is expected to underscore on one of the world\u2019s biggest stages the political and cultural divide over the administration\u2019s crackdown that led to the killing of two Americans in Minneapolis and spurred protests nationwide.  \n  \nTrump\u2019s border and immigration policies had been popular among the electorate over much of the past year. But after weeks of seeing masked federal agents tackling people on the street, detaining children and killing a pair of US citizens, just 34% of voters approve of how officials are enforcing the policy, down six points from two weeks prior, according to a Feb. 4 Quinnipiac poll.  \n  \n[Read the full story here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-07/bad-bunny-super-bowl-show-ice-protests-to-undercut-trump-s-midterm-message?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MDQ4NzUyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcxMDkyMzI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOVk0UUpLSzNOWTgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJEMzU0MUJFQjhBQUY0QkUwQkFBOUQzNkI3QjlCRjI4OCJ9.ZhJDgm8mWEQTfldqsTpjjqq-pWaXZhcujT1h7AtOg94)",

The article says:\n\n&gt; Under the terms of the policy, such immigrants are to be detained \"for the duration of their removal proceedings\" unless granted parole\n\nMy understanding of what's being \"changed\" by the 5th circuit here, is the removal of the \"unless granted parole\" part.\n\nThose detained are still only detained \"for the duration of their removal proceedings\"... so this does not, within the text of the ruling (or the policy) itself at least, claim that it's somehow now ok to just detain people indefinitely for no reason... which is not a thing that exists within US law.\n\nWhether or not this administration might actually attempt to keep detainees for unreasonable amounts of time is a separate issue, but at least in the context of this ruling, I don't see where it creates any kind of \"concentration camp\" like those are saying.\n\nI acknowledge I could be wrong somehow though, and I welcome any constructive criticism.",

Most liberal arts degrees are useless and require further education for professional career attainment. \n\nMore prosperous lives in what way? Reduced all cause mortality?

High school students aren't allowed to vote. \n\nYou're trying to convince me that high school students, 14-18 year old kids, have intellectual capacities to make informed civic decisions. Yet the national average for ALITERACY keeps rising, especially since we import illegal aliens who do not speak/read/write English. \n\nFrom NCB LA: \u201cOver the past four decades, the share of jobs requiring some form of postsecondary education continued to rise, while the literacy performance of American thirteen- and seventeen-year-olds remained flat, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  More than 60 percent of twelfth-grade students scored below the proficient level in reading achievement, and 27 percent scored below the basic level in reading. This means these lowest-performing high school seniors do not even have partial mastery of the appropriate grade-level knowledge and skills.\" https://thencbla.org/literacy-resources/statistics/\n\nCan't even imagine what math and science scores are! \n\nAlthough I can see how civic engagement can lead to financial success - like the protesters who get paid 4K a month to work 20 hrs a week protesting in various cities. \n\nIf you want an illiterate high school student making decisions for you and the country, WOW, I have no words. \n\nYou're not convincing me and I'm not convincing you.",

You want to reign ICE's abuses in?  Stop their paycheck!\n\nThat was the intent the framers had when they gave the House the power of the purse.  It allows the Legislative Branch to deal with an out of control Executive Branch.  Separation of Powers and all that.\n\nBut were sitting here with Dem's trying to push legislation to make ICE wear body case and not wear face masks.  And even that's too extreme!  Adding another law or rule (without penalty) to an out of control organization that doesn't follow laws is .... useless and ineffective.  They already ignore the constitution, ignore judicial orders ... they don't care!  What makes anyone think that one more law will make any difference?\n\nEvery single time the Dems are called out on this, every time somebody mentions \"rotating villain strategy\", it gets labeled as lacking evidence or at worst a conspiracy theory.  \n\nThis is relevant, because it is an article in mainstream press where a Democratic legislator more or less confirms this as their strategy.  Because we are not eating crazy pills.  We can see this BS with our own two eyes!",

There are of course more conservative (read : Orthodox) Jews who are wholly against it, but the larger interpretation of Exodus 21:22-23 is that a fetus is considered property, not a person, until birth; thus abortion is not considered murder. \n\nThere are some other references in the Talmud that can even be interpreted as stating that up to the 40 day mark in the gestational period, the embryo is considered  inconsequential.\n\nIt's an interesting rabbit hole to go down.\n\nEdit :\n\nFor a bit of historical context : Judaism is traditionally matrilineal, as in, a persons Jewish heritage is passed down from mother to child as opposed to father to child. This is largely due to a history of persecution, which led to Jewish men and boys of fighting age to be killed or forced to go to war. It tracks that the women would then be the head of their households. \n\nIn that mind, if a woman were to experience a complicated pregnancy that would not come to term, or would have negative effects on her ability to properly raise existing children (infants with defects or disabilities, physical and mental debilitation for the mother, socioeconomic factors), then it would be deemed rabbinically sound to be rid of said \"property\". \n\nAgain, the Torah states that a nefesh does not achieve personhood until birth. Any termination prior to 40 days, historically, would have been considered \"removing water\".\n\nAll of this leads to a Jewish stereotype that you may or may not be aware of : That Jewish wives/women are often domineering and critical, while Jewish husbands are considered nebbish or a schmuck. Again, matrilineal society/religion, with (modernly) less violent opposition; men/boys don't *necessarily* go to war but are still expected within their communities to be married to a Jewish woman, who has more than likely been raised with this context in mind.\n\nTL;DR/As an aside, as a non-practicing Atheist Jew : \n\nDon't fuck with Jewish women.",

This man has fought for every single one of us, every day of his political career. We know that he has lost many battles to the greed and the corruption of this country. But I am grateful for his voice. I am grateful that we have someone in our corner who fights for us.\n\nI am hopeful that the eyes and ears of our young citizens are open and paying close attention. If we want things to change here, it's going to take an uprising of epic proportions. But it is voices like Bernie's that will get us there. \n\nI hope that I may see my children live in a humane and cohesive society. It is sad that I have had to speak to my children and tell them that they should not bring children of their own into this world. And I'm going to stand by that, until and unless our nation can change for the better. \n\nThank you Bernie!",
