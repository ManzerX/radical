About the people chasing ICE around, do you know how dangerous that is? Not just for the ICE agents and the protestors (rioters/federal obstructionists) but the illegal immigrants and their families also. About the fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere? Do you know all the good that could have been done and indeed can be done with those amounts of money, if confirmed to be true (you have to be diplomatic like that). About the people that were \u201cindiscriminately shot in the streets\u201d? A tragedy, but really? How can we be saying that right now, while what\u2019s going on in Iran is happening?

I do not mind going to vote in person and providing documentation that I am a US citizen. However, I know everyone is not able bodied to go in and vote and they will use this to tighten the voting demographic. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair at all. I do think ICE reform needs to happen. Do you know that ICE training is only about 8 weeks like about 6 days a week (roughly 47\u2026. Sorry 48days). Most jobs have 90 day probation period.  Back in the day - pre all this chaos - basic training was 3-4 months and if additional training would be needed it would go up 4-5 months before even being on the field. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say",

They actually want them to sing it so they can catch them singing it. Then they can try to get them fired. It's just a weapon now. I think if they were a light switch then if you turned it off, the N-word would never have existed\u2026 A lot of liberals would never flick that switch. It's too valuable of a weapon to them. I remember a white professor getting fired because he was teaching about slavery. He used the word in a completely non-derogatory way while teaching about slavery. The fact that we are firing people for something like this is sickening.",

Obviously the officers are going to fear for their life? The story is very similar with Alex Pretti. Just stop fucking interfering with law enforcement.\n\nICE has been deporting illegal immigrants for multiple past administrations. Obama gave a fucking an award to Tom Homan for being good at deporting people.\n\nThis is all a ruse to 1) pin the left against the right even more and 2) a distraction from the rampant fraud being uncovered in Minnesota. Funny how it\u2019s the only state in disarray right now when most other states have or had ICE operations going.\n\nIt\u2019s really ironic that you\u2019re both an idiot and a dummy all at once.

Greenland isn\u2019t just ice and glaciers it\u2019s location, resources, and long-term security.\n\nI recently picked up a book on Amazon called We Need Greenland by Richard Bell, and it actually helped me put a lot of these thoughts into perspective. It\u2019s not some over-the-top political rant, more of a straightforward look at why Greenland matters geopolitically and why the U.S. should take it seriously.\n\nNot saying everyone will agree with the conclusions, but if you\u2019re even slightly concerned about America\u2019s strategic future in the Arctic, it\u2019s an interesting read.\nCurious what others here think. \nAm I overreacting, or is Greenland going to become a much bigger issue than most people realize?",

ICE is not trained to do crowd control. By Tim Walz and Jacob Frey doing that, it emboldens these liberals to think they can break the law. \n\nAlex Pretti and Ren\u00e9e Good\u2019s deaths were horrifingly terrible, but they made fatal mistakes to end up getting shot by ICE. Alex Pretti was armed as he grabbed an ICE officer, and Ren\u00e9e Good hit an ICE officer with her motor vehicle as she was obstructing them. ",

In minnesota the left have not won over any politically independent peoples minds or hearts. Normal sane people dont like when adults not being at work go around vandalizing other peoples property. Normal sane people especially HATE when leftists destroy other peoples property and never ever pay to repair or replace everything the leftists destroy. Leftists dont even pick up their own trash, yet they claim they care about a clean environment.",

So, since you know absolutely everything, serious question: Should the \u201cBabbit Rule\u201d regarding lethal force have been used when a BLM/Antifa mob burned down a police station in Minneapolis? Or what about in Richmond? Or when they unlawfully entered a federal courthouse in Portland? Or what about when an angry leftist mob stormed the Wisconsin state capital to stop an anti-union vote? Should the \u201cBabbitt Rule\u201d have been applied then? In Wisconsin, Democrats were tweeting out to the mob where they could **hunt down** Republicans escaping the building through tunnels. What should be their punishment?\n\nIn Babbitt\u2019s case the officer could have **easily** tased her. He could have **easily** maced her. He could have **easily** requested support from other officers loitering down the hall (not to mention officers who were *arm\u2019s length* from Babbitt on the **same side** of the door she was.)  So again, is it possible officers in this case were simply employing \u201cThe Babbitt Rule\u201d? The officer who murdered Babbit was treated as a **hero** after all and the \u201cmedia\u201d worried about whether *he* was the traumatized one. **Maybe the ICE officers thought that was the new standard of engagement???** And the coverup of the incident was a **textbook** example of a white-wash by our \u201cmedia\u201d/Democrats.\n\nSerious question.

That's partially the nature of politics unfortunately- it's literally called the opposition (Google it). \n\nAs for Pretti, look, I have sympathy. I was on a live zoom call and people I was on call with had connections to him (Americans have 7 degrees of separation). However, I appreciate battle of wits more than protests and violence. As a woman, I think violence just isn't in my DNA in the same way it is for men. It makes me physically ill in some cases.\n\nThat said, you and I are just not seeing the same thing. There's maybe 5 things going on at once with Pretti- Illegal \"immigration\" and the lawlessness it covers, foreign influence (China Tiktoks and Jihad radicalization of the people via Ilhan Omar), the Somali fraud (Tim Waltz pay-to-play), Pretti incident itself, and I guess 1st amendment/2nd amendment/self defense legality.\n\nI would love to discuss these issues in depth, however it would take hours. The conclusion I came to is, sad as it is, Pretti was radicalized into purposely obstructing ICE in a violent manner (he was kicking tail lights previously supposedly, and he carried a weapon to the protest so it was premeditated). During the incident, he didn't comply with ICE and he was shot when he reached for his midback and something fell. He could have had a second gun. People don't know.

It takes a simple google to debunk that. Back to Pretti. Law enforcement officers are condemning the incident. My cousin is an officer and he is pretty disappointed by this. Why did they pepper spray him in that moment first of all? Why did six of them start beating him? Why were no codes used to relate he was disarmed? How was he resisting? They never properly patted him down. Absolutely no de-escalation and general procedures whatsoever.

      "text": "**Please read to the end, before you assume my intentions. This does not come from a place of hatred but concern and anger. I apologize for how long it is, but I do truly think it's a conversation that needs to be had.**   \n  \nI want to start this off by saying this isn't a loaded question coming from some liberal lunatic (or a liberal at all). And this is not an anti-trump post.  This is simply coming from a terrified American who is watching you all praise the inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of both immigrants and American citizens, and I want to know why.\n\n**What would have to happen for you to consider what's happening with ICE isn't okay?**\n\n**I understand and agree with the idea that most people who are here illegally need to be deported. I understand and agree with the reason this has to happen; to help protect American people and legal immigrants.** But how is that being done if the methods its being enforced contradicts its reasoning?\n\nWe claim to be protecting American people. But there are people who are getting detained by ICE agents literally for protesting. A fact I couldn't even believe fully until I saw it with my own eyes at a protest I went to myself. We are watching online American citizens/legal immigrants being detained in methods that are sometimes very violent and leading to injury or death. And all I see when I come here is praise for it. Why is this okay to you?\n\nWe claim to be protecting women. Yet we are watching cases like ICE agent David Courvelle repeatedly raping a woman inmate in exchange for giving her a way to see her daughter with the help of other ICE agents receive little anger from right leaning politicians, media influencers, or communities like this. Why is this okay to you?\n\nWe claim to be protecting children. Yet we are watching children and their parents, both legal and illegal, be placed in detention centers where multiple people who were later released said how inhumane their treatment was there. And we are watching the children who aren't in detention centers be so terrified for their safety in Minnesota that some school districts had to reinforce virtual learning because large groups of them across their schools are too scared to go out of fear of encountering ICE. Why is this okay to you?\n\nWe claim to be protecting law and order. Yet we watched this week a veteran/nurse be executed in broad daylight because he was someone with a concealed weapon he had a permit to have on his person in an open carry state. And not only that, barely any time after his murder, multiple politicians and law enforcement openly lied about the threat he posed despite the ice agents already pulling the gun off of his person BEFORE THEY KILLED HIM. And the people in this community are cheering it on and actively mocking him. Why is this okay to you?\n\nI understand why getting people who came illegally processed and deported if need be. Please don't interpret this post as me being pro-illegal immigration. But the method that this has shown has brought so much fear, violence, and division that the trump administration is allowing. That y'all are not only allowing but encouraging. And at what point does enough start being enough? How is America supposed to be great again for all if we are putting essentially the majority of America in a state of fear and betrayal?\n\n**I made this post and hopefully the conversations that follow in good faith. I hope that the people who see this post approach any response they have in good faith as well. Have a good day, and god bless y'all.**",

But lets talk about the deaths of the other seven that happened in ICE custody so far in 2026. Those deaths were mostly a cause of violence and neglect from ICE agents and ICE facilities. Ice facilities are known for their mistreatment of their inmates, subjecting them to physical, mental, and sometimes sexual violence, all while keeping them in unsafe and unsanitary food, water, and living conditions. Those are undeniably the fault of ICE agents. Are they not? And if not, how so?",

Multiple past detainees have proven that this is happening, with them having to endure the things that were happening in these centers until their family could come and prove their citizenship to get them out. And with multiple centers providing little ways to communicate with their families, this could result in them being there for days, weeks, or months longer than they should be.

I want to trust that you are coming to this conversation with good faith...but the idea that you genuinely believe that Anti-ICE people want dangerous and awful people in our country because they are retaliating against what we can see is very concerning and dangerous behaviour from ICE feels like either blatant ignorance or a genuine lack of knowledge of the point of view of the other side. Both options are terrifying.\n\nAny sane person with this point of view does not want dangerous people in America. Point blank period, immigrant or not. And any sane person who has this point of view knows why at least the importance of coming here legally; no matter who it is. The issue that I mention in this post branches from the way that ICE has been treating people and going about the process. And the way it is affecting innocent and non-violent people. That does not mean that ICE isn't needed to a degree, that means that ICE needs to do it right and stop the violent, dangerous, inhumane, and unconstitutional manner that they are treating the people in america.\n\n2. You're right. They couldn't have known that he had a permit on him. That's undeniable. But that doesn't change the fact that they killed him after they already took his gun off of him and defused the threat that he would have caused if he had the intention to shoot them. And then proceeded to shoot him more after they already killed him. There were absolutely ways to go about that arrest that didn't include executing him; whether you think he should have had the gun there or not. \n\n3. I understand the idea of having to wear masks to preserve safety. But there is an undeniable lack of safety that comes with being able to hide your identity when it comes to matters like this. Any ICE agent could do dangerous and unlawful shit, and they wouldn't able to be identified; which can lead to a lack of accountability for their actions (something that barely matters since ICE gets absolute immunity now, but point still stands). Or any regular person could pose as an ICE agent and kidnap people, and we wouldn't know because there's no way to differentiate a actual ice agent from a random dude in a mask, a fake ICE suit, and a regular car. Not even mentioning the fear and confusion it is watching literally just random ass men picking up people from their schools, jobs, or literally just off the street.",

Yet these same people are most likely the same ones who hate ICE and want open borders without any sort of citizenship requirements. Imagine if we required passing basic English competency exams before granting citizenship like many other nations.

But I also can understand the high stress environment they are in.. These ICE agitators don\u2019t make anything better. They make it more dangerous for themselves and law enforcement..\n\nDo I think Alex Pretti should have been shot? No. But I do think that he made poor choices in that moment. He confronted Border Patrol and got involved in their operation, while he had a concealed weapon. Then proceeded to get into a tussle with them.. That alone is being an irresponsible conceal carry permit holder. \n\nIt was his responsibility in that situation to first of all not get involved at all, but secondly, comply, put his hands up and verbally express that he was armed and that he meant no harm. He didn\u2019t do that, from what I can hear.\n\nThere\u2019s blame on all sides here. Nothing about this shooting is black and white. There are a lot of angles and gray areas.",

I posted the video under a threat from pro ice, saying  that its all overdramatised. I immediately got banned. just this video\u2026 am i going to get banned in here too? my question is to everyone who support this is: why do you support this? (factively speaking). viewing this from the outside, it seems crazy how this topic is soo polarised. some people (from seeing these videos i can understand this clearly) are being scared and anti ice. but so many people are supporting it, I\u2019d like to hear those reasons. i would like an clear straight forward answer.

      "subreddit": "trump",
      "text": "This is about the legal responsibilities of citizens during police interactions and the contrast between extra-legal protests and the formal legal process of sponsoring an immigrant's status through the courts.\n\nThe recent tragedy in Minneapolis, where a man was shot and killed during an immigration crackdown and the National Guard was activated, is a tragedy that raises some serious questions about how we approach these situations.\n\nI have a fundamental question about conduct: Why would a person carrying a weapon choose to resist and fight the authorities? Furthermore, why do individuals refuse to present ID when asked, or behave aggressively when approached by police or ICE? These actions escalate situations that could otherwise be handled through due process.\n\nIf people truly want to stand with undocumented immigrants in their communities, there\u2019s a better way to help. Why don't they create groups to help sponsor them? \n\nInstead of protesting, why not pool resources to pay for legal and immigration fees.\n\nOr help them navigate the system to update their status and ensure they can remain in the country legally and safely?\n\nIsn\u2019t providing a legal pathway more helpful and productive than creating groups that bring chaos by protesting authorities? When people keep officers from doing their jobs and break laws themselves, they aren't solving the underlying issue.\n\nHow are \"activists\" actually helping by being agitators? If the goal was true support, there would be a movement focused on helping people comply with local laws. It seems many of these groups don't even respect the law themselves, which only hurts the people they claim to be protecting.",

Original text: \n\n&gt;They have not attacked ICE on a large-scale basis (I know the attack on the Texas facility happened, and it was wrong). However, people are attacked by ICE consistently, often merely for the color of their skin.\n\nThis is baseless, and I am prepared to prove it:\n\nNot a single ICE officer has been killed in the line of duty in the US, according to ICE's own website ([https://www.ice.gov/topics/eow](https://www.ice.gov/topics/eow)). There are some close incidents I will mention, however, lest anyone think I am omitting information.Two agents were shot (and one died) in Mexico by a gang when they were working at an embassy. One agent was killed in his home by an escaped inmate, but no connection was ever found, and it seems to be a random act of violence. Many, if not most, of other officers who died were killed by cancer relating to 9/11, or COVID. \n\nPeople are attacked by ICE consistently. This is an undeniable fact. Over 30 people have died in the last year while detained by ICE. 2 have died in the last 2 weeks in Minneapolis. Both of those deaths were against unarmed (at the time; video evidence shows that Pretti was disarmed earlier: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZHtDxRzMlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZHtDxRzMlE)) and were not attacking officers (Good did not hit Ross with her car, as an analysis shows: [https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/video/ice-shooting-renee-good-minneapolis-videos.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/video/ice-shooting-renee-good-minneapolis-videos.html). This can be based off of someone's perceived ethnicity (or \"color of their skin\"), as Wikipedia shows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavanaugh\\_stop).\n\nIf I am wrong/incorrect, please explain why.",

The magdump occurred after he was down because the gun was still within his reach.  While it's almost certain he was already in shock and on his way to whatever his eternal destination was, the agents at the time had no way of knowing that in the 1-2 seconds they needed to make the decision.

Ice not ICE played a part but it shouldn\u2019t have happened because one shouldn\u2019t physically fight officers especially if you have a loaded gun on your person. If you do you should announce it loudly so they don\u2019t do what happened. Complying and not fighting once you are being arrested also helps.\n\nThis situation is worse than Good and once again had they protested peacefully and not instigated this wouldn\u2019t happen.

This all happened in Minnesota under Tim Walz. \n\nWhen ICE started to crack down on illegal immigrants  in Minnesota he called for the people to fight them (insurrection) and called for \"peaceful\" protests which ended up to be riots. This involved many people getting pepper sprayed and arrested for obstructing law enforcement. Then we got Renee good who tried to run over and ICE officer and got shot. Instead of telling people to not run over law enforcement Tim Walz got up and called for the left wing to put up more and more fights. This caused many riots that caused destruction. Part of it is because he hates Trump and the other part is to distract people from the fraud. \n\nThen we have what happened today. A man pulled a gun on ICE agents and got shot. That alone is just showing how far down the drain Minnesota is and that Tim Walz has done nothing. He instead calls for more fighting (rioting) which will cause more destruction and chaos. \n\nThe best way to fix Minnesota is for Trump to enact the insurrection act in Minnesota and Tim should be investigated by the FBI for his fraud and insurrection.

He was shot at least 10 times by federal agents while attempting to protect a woman from being attacked.\n\nIf you are only following the official administration narrative, please watch the footage for yourself. Alex had one hand on his phone and one in the air. He was talking calmly before being tackled.\n\nThe video shows an agent disarm him and run away with his weapon. He was unarmed and being subdued when they proceeded to shoot him multiple times. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/s/d37hIoobKp\n\nIf they can do this to a US citizen, a healthcare worker, and a lawful gun owner exercising his 1st and 2nd Amendment rights\u2014they can do it to anyone. No one is safe when \"defensive shots\" are fired at unarmed, prone individuals.\n\nThe Numbers (Since Jan 1st, 2025):\n1. 38 people have died in ICE custody.\n2. 8 confirmed deaths from direct federal shootings.\n3. 17\u201327 shooting incidents (depending on the database).\n4. 5 of the people shot were US Citizens.\n\nIf you saw this happen to your son, brother, or neighbor outside your front door, would it be okay? Please make your own judgment.\n\nI don\u2019t care what side of the aisle you are on. This is not what should be happening in the USA. Murder is not the answer, we have more effective ways of removing Illegals without endangering them or our fellow US Citizens.",

We want him in charge.\"\n\nNot only did tampon Timmy lose, Trump became the first republican to win the popular vote in twenty years.  But Timmy think that _he_ deserved to win, and by that tack _he_ should be the one deciding federal policy.  Especially in Minnesota, which he runs like his own kingdom.  Money flows in from the feds to his associates, he keeps them out of trouble, and in return they keep him in office - the democrat plan since the 70's.  But the feds are interfering with one and two, and that's gonna cost him three.\n\nWalz is angry with Trump, and even more so with 'the people'.  Running things into the ground is largely out of revenge, and in pursuit of the notion that his antics and fabricated controversy will turn voters against Trump.",

They have been going to threads I commented on, on subs that have nothing to do with politics to try to embarrass me lol. They are going nuts today. I could give a shit about that lol. They can eat a dick.\n\nMy point is like yours. They have been attacking ice for over a year now. They have been trying to kill them. They have thrown rocks through their windshields. They have been spit on. They have had death threats, including their wives and children. They have been shot at with pistols and rifles. All of these things have been done to either try to hurt federal officers or try to scare the shit out of them so that they may make a misstep. This is part of their tactic. Let's get in their face and poke at them and poke at them until they make \"a mistake\". They are not peacefully protesting. They are violently rioting. So it's no wonder that these things have happened. And like you, I'm surprised more have not been hurt. The unbelievable restraint that ice agents have shown is like nothing I've ever seen. I've seen police officers in cop videos shoot people and not get convicted for way less than what ice agents are having to put up with.\n\nWe are also seeing calls for ice agents to be shot or murdered by liberal city leaders. Tim Walz using words like Nazi or Gestapo\u2026 That's just purposefully done to get his constituents to try to hurt them. We all know this. Even liberals know this because they're the ones calling for their deaths for over a year. So now we have a powder keg that didn't have to happen. All liberals had to do was stop the sanctuary city bullshit. Let ice detain and deport illegal aliens. If they arrest someone that shouldn't have been arrested, let it work out in court. Just like we do in America with the justice system and police officers lol. But they didn't want to do this. They want to have TDS, make Trump angry by all of a sudden wanting illegal aliens and taking up for them no matter what crime they have committed. Molestation? No problem. We don't want to notify ice. Murder? No problem. We're not going to notify ice.\n\nAnd now we're going to have even more violence. This was 100% totally avoidable by left leaning governors, congressman and mayors etc. Totally avoidable if they would've tone down the rhetoric. And remember, these are the same people that celebrated by the millions when Charlie Kirk was shot because they didn't like what he had to say in a debate. And now they're outraged.",

Where are the local Police? Why weren\u2019t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves \u2014 Not an easy thing to do! Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account? And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota? We are there because of massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing, and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats\u2019 Open Border Policy. We want the money back, and we want it back, NOW. Those Fraudsters who stole the money are going to jail, where they belong! This is no different than a really big Bank Robbery. Much of what you\u2019re witnessing is a COVER UP for this Theft and Fraud. The Mayor and the Governor are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric! Instead, these sanctimonious political fools should be looking for the Billions of Dollars that has been stolen from the people of Minnesota, and the United States of America. LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB! 12,000 Illegal Alien Criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota. If they were still there, you would see something far worse than you are witnessing today!\"\n\nSource: [https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/2015145393919774993](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/2015145393919774993)",

      "text": "I don't really have anyone to say this to so I'll say it here. Being in a democratic county, in a top school (that is also filled with so many liberal highschoolers) is tiring and draining. I go to a top school and these highschoolers are really smart yet, everyday I open Instagram, I get disappointed even more\n\nThey all hate ICE and Trump (cause why wouldn't they) and decided to have a walkout during the last few hours of school. It's the fact that they would stoop so low to do this and ughhh I can't even do anything about it. The principal caught onto this and addressed that she is glad the students are maturing into young adults (which is respectful considering it would be even worse if there was any political bias.) She also said that if you do skip class for the walkout, you will receive consequences.   \nHowever, the principal described walkouts are trendy and soon had to make another email reassuring what she meant (meaning walkouts are trendy, not hating ICE is even though we all know what's really trendy among young genz) \n\nObviously, the students took it the other way and were reposting it, bashing her at lunch, asking other students about it,  and stuff like that. It baffles me that these students see a headline such as \"ICE kidnaps 5 year old\", clicks reposts, and drains into the democratic narrative even more. I was asked \"Oh did you see the email\" and I got a bit uncomfortable and said No. \n\nThe point of this is that I understand there is a side of gen z that is conservative and actually has common sense, but growing up around all tons of liberal students and friends where I cannot say anything about how I feel because they will look pass that friendship for politics, I'd say that part me isn't feeling too optimistic. Even the debate team at my school is liberal. Even people at my church are falling into this too. I digress. I just feel disappointed.",

Sticking up and defending his own country and it's people. \n\nHe is not perfect but compared to any European leader he is pretty good. \n\nIt's unclear to me what's all the fuss about when it comes to ICE and the immigration policy. \n\nThe law is simple. Come legally and America will gladly accept you. What's the point of a country if it can't defend it's borders? \n\nSo yeah, I wish that Trump was the president of my country instead of a bunch of bureaucrats. \n\nEnjoy it while you have it America. Freedom is something that needs to be defended. God bless the US. ",

This militarization of ICE is cruel and spreading widespread and massive panic. The rights of citizens and immigrants alike are being trampled. But, you trump dick riders don\u2019t care what the supreme lord trump does, even if it goes against the constitution. You probably believe the election of 2020 was actually rigged, despite widespread proof disputing that point. This fool and his administration has lost in court again and again, yet you still try to defend him.",

The same could not said for trump buddy. Now in the trump adminstaration, there is literally a \u00a8zero-tolerence policy.\u00a8 Where they litterally target undocumented immigrants more than the actual criminals.

I was skeptical after i joined ICE recruitment, but now I'm ready. AMERICA is a place where EVERYONE has the FREEDOM to express thier opinions without being ATTACKED for it. This aint FUCKING IRAN, what do they think the outcome will be if EVERYONE played by thier rules? The \"If i DONT LIKE YOUR OPINION I CAN ATTACK YOU\" angle is really bad for them. The law of the land rules. Aggression is thier only push back. But if we could conquer Chicago, we can conquer and take back our ENTIRE country. To my fellow Americans, young men, women, if you are capable, please join the fight, the legal way. we have to take our country back from these lawless people. if not for you, for our children to be able to grow up in a world absent of this madness. Trump may be the only president left that will fix things. we need to move with him now. The Commander is leading the charge.  TRUMP KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO WHEN HE WON, AND HE HAS TO DO IT FAST. Nobody is perfect I don't seek perfection in man. the LEFT however is NOT WHAT I WANT for my country. God bless AMERICA. God bless You. ",

That\u2019s why things are and will continue to get worse. They\u2019re also not facing the consequences they deserve to face, so they\u2019re becoming more emboldened. I hate knowing we\u2019re going to see more death, but that\u2019s just the truth, and there\u2019s no way around it at this point.",

Even undocumented immigrants were being arrested when they went to attend court hearings relating to their ability to stay in the country... you know, trying to follow the law. But thanks to ICE, these people are forced into an impossible situation regardless of what the judges decide.\n\nBut yes, I very much agree that if ICE were just targetting violent immigrants, there would be a lot less resistance to their actions. I think Trump's target number of arrests and wanting to be seen to be taking action, and the lack of accountability when things go wrong, don't help the situation.",

I've seen, literally, NO GOP leadership who has endorsed/encouraged violence against the opposition as a method of achieving their goals. It's really, somewhat, mind-boggling because generally speaking the right is better armed, better trained and has more tactical experience. The left is loud, obnoxious, annoying, petulent, devoid of any common sense and frought with misguided virtue signaling. Conservatives sit back (more or less) quietly, watch and wait. If the left thinks the \"silence\" of the right means that the right \"fears\" the left, they're in for a very rude awakening if they \"level up.\"  We're watching; keeping our \"tools\" well-stocked, and in good working order; practicing and remaining in a state of readiness.",

        "body": "They also undercut our wages. The left wants to pretend it's \"jobs americans won't do\" but it's just we literally can't do for less than min wage. If they weren't around and companies had a hard time hiring, it would have to raise wages to attract more applicants. This is supply and demand 101. Look at the undesireable jobs like driving a stinky trash truck. No one wanted to work in waste management but they raised the wages/benefits and now you'd have a hard time getting one of those jobs. Then you consider they hardly pay any taxes (unless they are committing identity theft using other people's SS#), many of their children/anchor babies are on welfare, EBT, housing assistance etc. So they get to commit tax fraud and abuse our social programs all at once. But if a citizen did that, they would be in prison for tax fraud and denied social programs because they were hiding their income.\n\nBut we all know why they were invited and allowed to come in. The left cannot win elections without cheating and voter fraud. Exactly why they control the media, Zuckerberg admitted that the previous administration would call and make threats if they did not take down posts and censor people on their platform. They did the same censorship on Twitter before Elon bought it, shadowbanning accounts with great influence, banning sitting Presidents with bad excuses as to why. Not only illegals doing voter fraud, we've seen in 2020 people carrying rolling luguage bags into election centers (4 or more) and hiding them under tables. They used covid (Biden back channel deals using Hunter and China affiliation, what a surprise it originated in Wuhan labs such a coincidence) to suppress voting as well as use mail in ballot to commit more voter fraud. Now they have people on the left defending somali fraudsters and illegal aliens, imagine the brainwashing. You can make a long video of democrat leaders being against illegal immigration for the past 2-3 decades. But now they need illegal votes so they go along with it. So disgusting.",

But I didn\u2019t think as a middle class white I\u2019d ever actually be affected by his policies. Unfortunately that was an absurd fantasy. Outside of the fact that the economy fucking sucks (except the stock market which is great whoo! Who gives a shit tho because most of my stocks are in my 401k and I\u2019m nowhere close to retirement), my daily costs haven\u2019t come down. Groceries are insane. Gas is \u2026 ok? It\u2019s not that much different than a year ago. Speaking of inflation: Interest rates are insane. I can\u2019t refi my truck and my husband and I have been renting for 3 years waiting for rates to come down to buy. Funny thing! Home prices, rent prices and interest rates are all still absurd. So cool, very easy to build up that down payment and slide into an affordable mortgage payment. Right. Oh, and my husband was laid off from his manufacturing job and been unable to find anything for 11 months. He has a business degree and has worked in manufacturing his entire career. He\u2019s literally never had an issue previously finding employment. It\u2019s more often employers seek him out. Unemployment has run out recently so thank goodness for my income and our veterans benefits. He\u2019s going fucking crazy at home though so pray he finds something soon.\n\nI guess I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t feel better than I did a year ago. I kinda feel worse. Thank god I\u2019m employed and have healthcare at least.\n\nHonest question- what does this whole \u201cget the illegals out\u201d thing do for us? Trump has kept his word on one promise only and that\u2019s getting people out. Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s helping anyone. In case you\u2019re wondering I\u2019m a US citizen. Employed, married to a man, have kids and all that. I\u2019m not some adversarial liberal agitator. Again, honest question. What are you seeing that\u2019s going well?",

He told us he loves air which we found racist and  we refused to take it in. Which led to more deaths. Blame Trump! Blame Trump!\n\nAll I see from liberals are stupid Hollywood celebrities who think their political beliefs matters to us. And a bunch of angry white women who are unwed with a bunch of cats. And a bunch of angry homosexuals ready to shoot up a school.\n\nThey turn society losers like George Floyd (a convicted felon) and Renee Good (a deadbeat, abusive mother who turned lesbian) into these national heroes and martyrs. They protest for no dictators, no kings. When Trump removes one in Venezuela, all of a sudden it's inhumane and wrong.\n\nFuck Democrats. Trump needs to expose all these lying frauds. Give us more about the rigged election that happened in 2020. Show us what happened in that Somali daycare stealing money from people.\n\nIryna Zarutska gets randomly killed by a convicted Black man who was back on the streets. The Left doesn't even wince an eye for her. But if Renee was told to stop, and she refused and almost hit an ICE agent with a car, the ICE agent is viewed as a murderer because the stupid bitch refused to listen. Then WOKE fucks like Steve Kerr and Doc Rivers will say Renee was just trying to drive back home..\n\nThese liberals didn't shed a tear for Charlie. Laughed and celebrated. Even mocked his death in memes and saying he deserved to die from his fascist remarks. Was pissed that Trump wasn't killed. Why should we give a fuck about Renee? She put that shit on herself. George and Renee can rot in hell for all I care like the rest of these lying liberals.\n\nFuck Democrats. Never vote for this lying l  asshole party ever again. They turn to criminals as their heroes and martyrs. They need votes from illegal aliens and criminals to keep them in power while they do nothing for these people when elected. They need the media and Hollywood celebrities to lie for them.\n\nWhen Charlie was killed, liberals still had the audicity to blame Trump when the shooter was anti-Trump. Right, TDS Jimmy Kimmel? It always come down to blaming Trump for everyone\u2019s problems and not looking in a mirror.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxj192ox26dg1.jpeg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f8538b9959d35e7b922b73fc57ece34e8614fc5",

      "author": "[deleted]",
      "subreddit": "trump",
      "text": "I\u2019m asking this in good faith and I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand the difference in public reaction, not defend or attack any specific politician.\n\nI recently watched video from a current ICE-involved shooting that\u2019s getting a lot of national attention. While watching it, I started thinking back to the Obama years and realized that there were also deaths involving immigration or border enforcement back then, including cases with video and disputed use of force.\n\nFrom what I can tell, these kinds of incidents did happen during the Obama administration, but they didn\u2019t seem to generate the same level of sustained national outrage or media focus that similar cases do now.\n\nFor context, Obama deported over 3 million people during his presidency, more than any modern president. There were also documented deaths in ICE custody during that time, and multiple CBP use-of-force incidents along the border where DOJ declined to prosecute. Immigration activists even referred to Obama as the \u201cDeporter-in-Chief\u201d at the time, but that criticism mostly stayed within activist circles and didn\u2019t dominate national media.\n\nI\u2019m not saying criticism today is wrong or that any death is acceptable. I\u2019m honestly trying to understand why the reaction feels so different now when the underlying enforcement agencies, legal standards, and tactics seem largely unchanged.\n\nIs it mainly because of changes in the media environment and social media amplification? Is it about Trump\u2019s rhetoric and symbolism compared to Obama\u2019s? Or have activist coalitions and political narratives shifted in a way that makes similar events land very differently with the public?\n\nIf people disagree and think the Obama-era cases received similar levels of attention, I\u2019m open to examples. I\u2019m interested in understanding why the response feels asymmetric, not scoring points for either side.",

I'm not here to get into the morality of it all but one thing I've noticed, is that there's a lot of instances where they're going to schools and workplaces.\n\nAs a non american, in my country you wouldn't be able to get a job legally or go to school here without having the right to live/work here. Obviously there will be some sketchy companies hiring people illegally and paying cash in hand but this would be generally be really small companies. A company equivalent to Target here would not be able to hire illegals as they wouldn't have the documentation to get set up as an employee. Large companies would not get away with hiring someone under the books and doing cash in hand.\n\nI'm basically finding it crazy that many of these checks will be on school kids or people at work places. As surely they must be a legal citizen or have a visa to work or go to school? Or does America not have proof of citizenship checks for these things?\n\nIf they do, it makes zero logical sense to waste taxpayers money on resources to check the citizenship of PoC that are employed at large/chain organisations. If you were going to target anywhere, would you not go to the small, typically cash only businesses, which are also likely full of owners cheating their taxes.\n\nIt also shocks me that you guys have to work out your taxes yourselves so I dont think id be shocked if these pre-employment checks also didnt exist!
