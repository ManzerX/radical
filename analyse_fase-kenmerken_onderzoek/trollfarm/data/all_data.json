Its just law enforcement enforcing our laws and in this case they are the particular laws the majority of us voted to be enforced. Taking away their cheap labor that can be abused by their bosses and that get counted towards the EC and House in the census has then really upset and so they unleashed this on our country... its insane how power hungry they are that they harm the very people they claim to want to help\u00a0",

When I woke up, the nurse asked if I'd like some cranberry juice, to which I said yes and she brought me two small 8oz juices. Luckily it was all covered by my company's workers comp insurance, but they mailed me an invoice for my stay. I don't remember the total price of the surgery, but I specifically remember those juices were $17 each, for something I could buy at the grocery store for less than 50 cents a pop.",

It occurs when a person directs their internal distress, lack of purpose, or frustration outward through aggression, impulsivity, or defiance.\n\u200bKey Concepts\n\u200bExternalizing Behaviors: Actions like rule-breaking or irritability used to cope with underlying confusion or low self-regulation.\n\u200bIdentity Diffusion: A state where an individual lacks a clear sense of self or life direction, often leading to erratic behavior.\n\u200bActing Out: The literal term for performing an action to express pent-up emotions or \"voids\" that the person cannot put into words.\n",

One can only hope it will go the way of the Oscars, which will be shown through YouTube in the future due to low live ratings.\n\nThe only reason these shows continue to air with less ratings is they become social media GOLD for the left. 102 million interacted with Grammy content on social media in 2025 versus those who chose to watch it live. Data derived from Google.\n\nConclusion: the less you interact with social media, the less the left/democrats are indoctrinated with hate.

In ecology or resource management, people sometimes reject population control because it feels cruel in isolation, even when the alternative is long-term collapse that hurts everyone. Policy works the same way. You can have compassionate intentions and still create outcomes that are objectively worse if you refuse to acknowledge tradeoffs.\n\nMany progressive positions seem rooted in symbolism and moral signaling rather than consequences. The immediate feeling of virtue takes priority over whether policies actually protect the vulnerable, preserve trust in institutions, or prevent predictable abuse. Refusing to set boundaries doesn\u2019t make a system humane; it makes it fragile. Long-term stewardship sometimes requires saying no, even when no feels uncomfortable.\n\nFrom that perspective, the disagreement isn\u2019t about compassion versus cruelty. It\u2019s about whether you\u2019re willing to look beyond intentions and judge ideas by what they reliably produce over time.",

They want to be seen as nice people. They're more worried about hurting feelings than creating competence and accountability.\n\nThey never stop to think about results. As in, Democrat policy decisions very often make things worse: addiction, homelessness, crime, poverty, unaffordable housing, energy costs...  The list goes on and on.  I mean, is any of that getting better? No. No, it isn't.

People don't seem to be aware that ICE has been around a long time, doing a lot of important work in protecting citizens, with some highly qualified and competent agents.\n\nBut there has also been a huge influx of new recruits, and honestly I think that they are not trained to the same level. The problem with mass recruitment is the time it takes to give them the training they need, as the experienced agents are spread too thin to educate them.\n\nSo I hope we're not seeing logistical mistakes, such as West Virginia and Texas mostly being all those experienced agents, whilst the more rapid redeployment teams being made up of people who have not been in the job for a year.",
